mathLink: a basis for the metric topology from dense subset proposition
---
>[!prop]
Let $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric Space]], $\{a_{1},a_{2},\ldots\}$ be a [[Dense]] [[Subset]] of $X$, and $\{r_{1},r_{2},\ldots\}$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers between $0$ and $1$. Then,
$$\mathcal{B}=\{B_{d}(a_{n},r_{m}):m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$$
is a [[Basis of a Topology]] for the [[Metric Topology]] on $X$.
