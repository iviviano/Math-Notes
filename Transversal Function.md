Let $f:X \mapsto Y$ be a [[Smooth]] [[Function]]. $f$ is said to be *transversal* to the [[Submanifold]] $Z$ of $Y$ if for each $x\in f^{-1}(Z)$, $$\text{Image}(df_{x})+T_{y}(Z)=T_{y}(Y)$$for $y=f(x)$.

>[!note]
>The [[Preimage Theorem]] is a special case of this

>[!not]
>This is notated: $$f\topfork Z$$
