```ad-def
The *cartesian product* of [[Set]]s $A$ and $B$:
$$A\times B = \{(a, b): a\in A \text{ and } b\in B\}$$
```

Notation: [[notation for cartesian product|notation for cartesian product]]

```ad-def
Let $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in J}$ be an indexed family of sets; let $X$ = [[Notation/union|union]]$A_\alpha$. The *cartesian product* of this indexed family, denoted by 
$$\prod_{\alpha\in J}A_\alpha$$
is defined to be the set of all $J-$[[Tuple]]s $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_\alpha \in A_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in J$. Formally, it is the set of all [[Function]]s 
$$\mathbf{x}:J\rightarrow\bigcup A_\alpha$$
such that $\mathbf{x}(\alpha)\in A_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in J$.
