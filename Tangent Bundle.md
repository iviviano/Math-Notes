>[!def]
>Let $X$ be a [[Manifold]] in $\mathbb{R}^N$. The *tangent bundle* of $X$ is defined as: $$T(X)=\{(x,v)\in X\times \mathbb{R}^{N}:v\in T_{x}(X)\}$$

>[!note]
>$T(X)$ contains a natural copy $X_{0}$ of $X$, consisting of the points $(x,0)$. It contains copies of each [[Tangent Space]] $T_{x}(X)$, as [[Embedding]]s of the [[Set]]s $\{(x,v):\text{ with }x \text{ fixed}\}$.
