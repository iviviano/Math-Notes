Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Let $\{f_{n}\}$ be [[Bounded Function into R]] [[Function]]s from $X$ into $\mathbb{R}$. Then, $f_{n}$ is a *uniformly Cauchy sequence* if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n,mâ‰¥N$, and for all $x\in X$, $|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)|<\epsilon$.
