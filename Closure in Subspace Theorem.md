mathLink: closure in subspace theorem

```ad-thm
Let $Y$ be a [[Subspace]] of $X$. Let $A$ be a [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] of $Y$. Let [[closure]] denote the [[Topology/Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $X$. Then, the [[Topology/Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$ equals [[closure]] [[Notation/intersection|intersection]] $Y$.
```

Note: in the situation above, [[notation for closure]] refers to the [[Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $X$, which is generally different than the [[Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$. 

```ad-proof
The [[Topology/Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$ is the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] of all [[Closed Set]] sets in $Y$ containing $A$. Any [[Closed Set]] set in $Y$ can be written as the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] of a [[Closed Set]] set in $X$ with $Y$ by the [[Closed Sets in Subspace Theorem]]. By the comutativity and associativity of the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]], the [[Topology/Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$ is the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] of all closed sets in $X$ containing $A$ [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]]ed with $Y$.
