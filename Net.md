>[!def]
A *net* in a [[Set]] $X$ is a pair $(x,I)$, where $I$ is a [[Directed Set]] set, and $x$ is a [[Function]]: $$x:I \rightarrow X$$

>[!not]
>Nets are often denoted: $$\{x_{i}:i\in I\}$$

Examples:
1. any [[Sequence]] is a net
2. $X$ is any [[Set]], [[Power Set]] $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is [[Directed Set]] with containment. For $A\in \mathcal{P}(X)$, let $x_{A}\in A$. Then, $\{x_A\}$ is a net.
