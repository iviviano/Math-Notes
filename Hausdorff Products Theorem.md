> [!thm]
> If each space $X_\alpha$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]], then $\prod X_\alpha$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]] in both the [[Box Topology]] and the [[Product Topology]].

Let $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2\in\prod X_\alpha$. For each $\alpha$ pick $U_\alpha$ and $V_\alpha$ such that $\mathbf{x}_{\alpha1}\in U_\alpha$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\alpha2}\in V_\alpha$, and $U_\alpha\cap V_\alpha$ is [[Disjoint]]. Then,
