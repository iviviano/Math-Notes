```ad-prop
Let $X$ be a [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]. Suppose [[Notation/basis|basis]] is a collection of [[Open Set]] sets of $X$ such that for any [[Open Set]] set $U$[[Notation/subset|subset]]$X$ and each $x\in U$, there is an element $B\in$ [[Notation/basis|basis]] such that $x\in B\subseteq U$. Then [[Notation/basis|basis]] is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Topology]] on $X$.
