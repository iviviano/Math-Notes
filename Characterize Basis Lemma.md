> Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Suppose [[notation for basis]] is a collection of [[Open Set]] sets of $X$ such that for any [[Open Set]] set $U$ [[notation for subset]] $X$ and each $x\in U$, there is an element $B\in$ [[notation for basis]] such that $x\in B\subseteq U$. Then [[notation for basis]] is a [[Basis of a Topology]] for the [[Topology]] on $X$.
