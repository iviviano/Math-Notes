>Let $X$ be a $k$-dimensional [[Manifold]]. Let $x\in X$. Then, $x$ possesses a [[Neighborhood]] $V\subseteq X$ of $x$ such that $V$ is [[Diffeomorphic]] to an [[Open Set]] $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$. A [[Diffeomorphism]] $\phi: U \rightarrow V$ is called a *parameterization* of the [[Neighborhood]] $V$.
>>[!note]
>>$V=V'\cap X$ for some [[Neighborhood]] $V'\subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$.
