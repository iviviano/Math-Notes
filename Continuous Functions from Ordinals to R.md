mathLink: continuous functions from ordinals to $\mathbb{R}$ are eventually constant
---
>[!prop]
>If $f:[0,\Omega)\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is a [[Continuous]] [[Function]], then there is a point $a\in[0,\Omega)$ such that $f$ is constant on $\{x\in[0,\Omega):xâ‰¥a\}$.

>[!prop] Corollary
>If $f:[0,\Omega]\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is [[Continuous]], then $f$ is [[Bounded Function into R]].

>[!prop] Corollary
>The [[Stone-Ceck Compactification]] of $[0,\Omega)$ is the [[Topological Space]] $[0,\Omega]$ which is also its [[One Point Compactification]].
