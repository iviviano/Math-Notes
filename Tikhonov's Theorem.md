>[!thm]
>If $\{X_{i}:i\in I\}$ is a [[Collection]] of [[Topological Space]]s and their [[Cartesian Product]] $X$ is given the [[Product Topology]], then $X$ is [[Compactness]] [[iff]] $X_{i}$ is [[Compactness]] for each $i\in I$.

As each projection map is [[Continuous]], when $X$ is [[Compactness]], so is $X_{i}$ for all $i$ by the [[Extreme Value Theorem]]. Suppose each $X_{i}$ is [[Compactness]].

Let $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ be an [[Open Cover]] of $X_{i}$. 

Let $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ be an [[Open Cover]] of $X$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is the [[Basis]] for the [[Product Topology]] given by the [[Basis for the Product Topology Theorem]]. Then, for each $U\in \mathcal{U}$, $U$ is [[Open Set]] in only finitely many $X_{i}$.
