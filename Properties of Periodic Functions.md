Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a $T$-[[Periodic]] [[Function]] for $T>0$. Then, $f$ is said to be 
>1. [[Riemann Integrable]] if $f$ is [[Riemann Integrable]] on a [[Period Interval]] $[a,a+T]$, for some $a\in \mathbb{R}$
>2. [[Piece-wise Continuous]] if $f$ is [[Piece-wise Continuous]] on a [[Period Interval]] $[a,a+T]$ for some $a\in \mathbb{R}$
>3. $k$-[[Times Continuously Differentiable]] for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$ if $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^k$ on some [[Bounded Metric Space]] [[Open Interval]] $(a,b)\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with $b-a>T$. 

>[!note]
>$T$ is not necessarily the minimum period
