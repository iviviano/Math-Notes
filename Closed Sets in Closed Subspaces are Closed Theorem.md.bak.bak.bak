mathLink: closed sets in closed subspaces are closed
---
> [!thm]
> Let $Y$ be a [[Subspace]] of $X$. If $A$ is [[Closed Set]] in $Y$ and $Y$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$, then $A$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$.

> [!proof]
> $A$ can be written as the [[Intersection]] of a [[Closed Set]] set in $X$ with $Y$ by the [[Closed Sets in Subspace Theorem]]. As both of these [[Set]]s are [[Closed Set]] in $X$, so is there [[Intersection]].
