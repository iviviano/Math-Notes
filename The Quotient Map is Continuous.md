mathLink: the quotient map is continuous
---
>[!prop]
>Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] with an [[Equivalence Relation]] $\sim$. If $q:X \rightarrow X/\sim$ is the [[Quotient Map]], then $$\mathcal{U}=\{U\subseteq X/\sim:q^{-1}(U)\text{ is open in }X\}$$is a [[Topology]] on $X$ and $q$ becomes a [[Continuous]] [[Function]].

>[!note]
$\mathcal{U}$ may not satisfy the [[Hausdorff Axiom]] even if $X$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]].
