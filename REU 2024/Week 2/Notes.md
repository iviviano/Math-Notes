Zoom meeting with Larson group on Brownian Dynamics at 5pm on Monday


Oseen theory gives the drag forces as $$F_{i}^{d}=V \zeta - \frac{h}{N}\sum_{j≠i}\Omega_{ij}F_{j}^{d}$$
in units $\frac{kT}{\text{m}}$

The contribution of drag to potential is: $$U_{i}^{d}=-x_{i}F_{i}^{d}$$

examples folder in lammps

TODO:
look at HOOMD-blue and compare to LAMMPS

look at notes on finite difference scheme
- reproduce calculations up to page 39
- change to periodic boundary conditions
Meet on Thursday at 4pm

Plot the fourier series for the initial condition shown in the notes


Allen-Cahn equation $$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}=\epsilon\nabla^{2}\phi+\phi-\phi^{3}$$
$-1≤\phi≤1$

>[!question]
>Can we look at the expected value of certain quantities of interest using statistical mechanics and [[Monte Carlo]] integration?
