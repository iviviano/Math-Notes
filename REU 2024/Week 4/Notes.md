1D Cahn-Hilliard
- fourth derivative
- need four boundary conditions
Proof of mass conservation for Neumann BC's
- does this also hold for periodic BC's
Perturbation
- solutions of linearized problem - growing solution (some grow, some decay)
	- linear mode that is unstable and grows the fastest
- or random perturbation

>[!question]
Can we show a mass conservation constraint with the fourier coefficients? (0-th coefficient is integral)
