>The [[Set]] of *distributions* is defined as the [[Dual Space]] of the [[Set]] of [[Test Functions]], $\mathcal{D(\Omega)}$ and is denoted $$\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$$This is the [[Set]] of real-valued [[Linear]] [[Functional]]s on $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$.

Denote the $\mathcal{D},\mathcal{D}'$ pairing by $$\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\mathcal{D}',\mathcal{D}}$$
