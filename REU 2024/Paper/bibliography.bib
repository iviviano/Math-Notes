We illustrate how to select the conservative force coefficient, the cut-off radius, and the DPD time scale in order to simulate a LJ fluid. To show the effects of coarse graining and establish accuracy in the DPD simulations, we conduct equilibrium simulations, Couette flow simulations, Poiseuille flow simulations, and simulations of flow around a periodic array of square cylinders. For the last flow problem, additional comparisons are performed against continuum simulations based on the spectral/hp element method.}",

  title    = "Molecular calculation of the critical parameters of classical
              helium",
  author   = "Messerly, Richard A and Gokul, Navneeth and Schultz, Andrew J and

  IGNOREabstract = "We compute the vapor-liquid critical coordinates of a model of
              helium in which nuclear quantum effects are absent. We employ
              highly accurate ab initio pair and three-body potentials and
              calculate the critical parameters rigorously in two ways. First,
              we calculate the virial coefficients up to the seventh and find
              the point where an isotherm satisfies the critical conditions.
              Second, we use Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) to calculate the
              vapor-liquid equilibrium, and extrapolate the phase envelope to
              the critical point. Both methods yield results that are
              consistent within their uncertainties. The critical temperature
              of ``classical helium'' is 13.0 K (compared to 5.2 K for real
              helium), the critical pressure is 0.93 MPa, and the critical
              density is 28.4 mol·L-1, with expanded uncertainties
              (corresponding to a 95\% confidence interval) on the order of 0.1
              K, 0.02 MPa, and 0.5 mol·L-1, respectively. The effect of
              three-body interactions on the location of the critical point is
              small (lowering the critical temperature by roughly 0.1 K),
              suggesting that we are justified in ignoring four-body and higher
              interactions in our calculations. This work is motivated by the
              use of corresponding-states models for mixtures containing helium
              (such as some natural gases) at higher temperatures where quantum
              effects are expected to be negligible; in these situations, the
              distortion of the critical properties by quantum effects causes
              problems for the corresponding-states treatment.",
