```ad-def
If [[Notation/topological space|topological space]] is a [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]] and $x\in X$, we say $x$ is a *limit point* of $A$ if every [[Neighborhood]] of $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$ at some point other than $x$ itself:
$$\forall U\in T: x\in U: (A - \{x\})\cap U \ne \emptyset$$

Equivalently, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if it belongs to the [[Topology/Closure|Closure]] of $A - \{x\}$.
