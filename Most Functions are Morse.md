>Let $f:X \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a [[Function]] where $X$ is a [[Manifold]]. For $a\in \mathbb{R}^N$, define a new [[Function]] $f_{a}$ on $X$ by $$f_{a}=f+a_{1}x_{1}+\cdots+a_N x_n$$Then, the [[Set]] of points $a\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f_{a}$ is not a [[Morse Function]] has [[Measure 0 on Manifolds]].
