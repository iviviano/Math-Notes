mathLink: irrationality of $\log$

>[!prop]
>1. For all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ with $n≥2$, one has $$\log_{2} \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)\in \mathbb{R}-\mathbb{Q}$$
>2. Let $a,b,c\in \mathbb{N}$ with $b,c≠1$. Suppose there exists a prime $p$ which only contributes to the [[Prime Factorization]] of precisely one of $a$ or $b$ or $c$. Then, $\log_{a}(b)$ and $\log_{a}(c)$ are independent over $\mathbb{Q}$: there are no $n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $$n_{1}\log_{a}(b)+n_{2}\log_{a}(c)=n_{3}$$besides $n_{1}=n_{2}=n_{3}=0$
