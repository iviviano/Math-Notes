mathLink: basis characterization of finer topologies

```ad-prop
Let [[Notation/basis|basis]] and [[Notation/basis|basis]]' be bases for the [[Topology]]s $T$ and $T'$ on $X$. Then the following are equivalent.
1. $T'$ is [[Topology/Finer|Finer]] than $T$
2. $\forall x\in X$ and each [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] element $B\in\mathcal{B}$ containing $x$, there is a basis element $B'\in\mathcal{B'}$ such that $x\in B'\subseteq B$.
