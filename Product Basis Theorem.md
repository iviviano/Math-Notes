```ad-def
If [[Notation/basis|basis]] is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Topology]] of $X$ and $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Topology]] $Y$, then the collection:
	$$\mathcal{D} = \{B\times C|B\in\mathcal{B}\text{ and } C\in\mathcal{C}\}$$

is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]] of $X$ and $Y$.
