>[!thm]
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]]. Let $\{\phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{k}\}$ be a [[Basis of a Vector Space]] for the [[Dual Space]] $V^{*}$. Then, the $p$-[[P-Tensor]]s $$\{\phi_{i_{1}}\otimes\cdots\otimes \phi_{i_{p}}:1≤i_{1},\ldots,i_{p}≤k\}$$form a [[Basis of a Vector Space]] for the [[Vector Space of Tensors]] on $V$.

>[!note]
>This is the [[Collection]] of all orders of [[Tensor Product]]s of the basis elements of the [[Dual Space]].
