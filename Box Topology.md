> Consider the general [[Cartesian Product]]s:
> $X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n \text{  and  } X_1\times X_2\times\cdots$
> where each $X_i$ is a [[Topological Space]]. 
> 
> Then, the *box topology* on the product space can be formed using the as [[Basis of a Topology]] all sets of the form: $U_1\times\cdots\times U_n$ in the first case, and of $U_1\times U_2\cdots$ in the second case, where $U_i$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_i$ for each $i$.
