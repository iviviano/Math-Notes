>A [[Topological Space]] $(X,T)$ is *[[Local]]ly connected* if for every $x\in X$ and every [[Neighborhood]] $G$ of $x$, there is a [[Connected]] [[Neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ with $U\subseteq G$.

Example:
1. Any [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ is locally connected. 
2. A [[Discrete Topology]] space is not [[Connected]], but is locally connected.
