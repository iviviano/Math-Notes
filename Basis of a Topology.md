> A [[Set]] $\mathcal{B}$ is a *basis* for a [[Topological Space]], [[notation for topological space]] [[iff]] 
> 1. For each $x\in X$, there is at least one basis element containing $x$
> 2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3$[[notation for subset]]$B_1$[[notation for intersection]]$B_2$
> 
> The [[Topology]] generated by the basis $\mathcal{B}$ is defined where: A [[Subset]] $U$ of $X$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$ if for each $x\in U$, there is a basis element $B$ containing $x$ with $B$ [[notation for subset]] $U$.

Notation: [[notation for basis]]

Examples:
1. $\mathcal{B}=T$ is always a basis
2. If $(X,d)$ is a [[Metric Space]], the [[Collection]] $\mathcal{B}=\{B_{d}(X,\epsilon):x\in X,\epsilon>0\}$ is a [[Basis of a Topology]]
3. If $(X,d)$ is a [[Metric Space]], the [[Collection]] $\mathcal{B}=\{B_{d}(x,\epsilon):x\in X,\epsilon>0,\epsilon\in \mathbb{Q}\}$ is a [[Basis of a Topology]].
