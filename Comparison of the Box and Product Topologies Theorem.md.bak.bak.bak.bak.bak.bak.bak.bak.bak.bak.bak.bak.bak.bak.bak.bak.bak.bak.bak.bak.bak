mathLink: comparison of the box and product topologies theorem

> [!thm]
> The [[Box Topology]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ has as [[Basis]] all [[Set]]s of the form $\prod U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. The [[Product Topoplogy]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ has as [[Basis]] all sets of the form $\prod U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$ and $U_\alpha$ equals $X_\alpha$ except for finitely many values of $\alpha$. 

> [!thm]
> The statement about the [[Basis]] for the [[Box Topology]] is true by definition.
> Consider the [[Basis]] generated by the [[Subbasis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]]. Let 
> $\mathcal{S} = \{\pi_\alpha^{-1}(U_\alpha) : U_\alpha \text{ is open in } X_\alpha\}$
> be a the [[Subbasis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ ([[Subbasis for the Product Topology Theorem]]). Let [[basis]] be the [[Basis]] generated by [[subbasis]]. Then, $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is a finite [[Intersection]]s of elements of [[subbasis]]. Particularly, $B_\alpha$ is a finite [[Intersection]]s of [[Open Set]]s sets of $X_\alpha$, so it is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ (the $\alpha$th component of each [[Subbasis]] element is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$). [[therefore]] The [[Basis]] described above is a [[Subset]] of [[basis]] (Almost correct reasoning). 
> Let $B = \prod U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ and $U_\alpha$ equals $X_\alpha$ except for finitely many $\alpha$. Let $J = \{\alpha: U_\alpha \ne X_\alpha\}$. $J$ is finite. As $B_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, $\pi_\alpha^{-1}(B_\alpha)\in$ [[subbasis]]. 
> $B = \bigcup_{\alpha\in J}\pi_\alpha^{-1}(B_\alpha)$
> so, $B$ is in the [[Basis]] generated by the [[Subbasis]] [[subbasis]].
> [[therefore]] the two bases are equal

> [!prop] Correlary
> The [[Box Topology]] is [[Finer]] than the [[Product Topoplogy]].
