>[!def]
>Let $X,Y$ be [[Manifold]]s. Any [[Smooth]] map $f:X \mapsto Y$ induces a *global derivative map*: $df:T(X)\mapsto T(Y)$ defined by $$df(x,v)=(f(x),df_{x}(v))$$

>[!note]
>[[Diffeomorphic]] [[Manifold]]s have [[Diffeomorphic]] [[Tangent Bundle]]s

>[!question]
>Is this the same as the [[Differential]] of $f$?
