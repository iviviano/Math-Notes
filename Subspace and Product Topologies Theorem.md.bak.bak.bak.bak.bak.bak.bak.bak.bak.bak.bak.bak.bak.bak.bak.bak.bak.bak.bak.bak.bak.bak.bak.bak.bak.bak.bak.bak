mathLink: subspace and product topology theorem

> [!thm]
> If $A$ is a [[Subspace]] of $X$ and $B$ is a [[Subspace]] of $Y$, then the [[Product Topoplogy]] on $A$ [[cartesian product]] $B$ is the same as the [[Topology]] $A\times B$ inherits as a [[Subspace]] of $X\times Y$.

Note: A similar result does not hold when considering $X$ under the [[Order Topology]]. If $A$ is a [[Subset|Subset]] of $X$, the [[Order Topology]] on $A$ is not necessarily the same as the [[Subspace Topology]] on $A$.

> [!proof]
> Let $U$ [[cartesian product]] $V$ be an arbitrary [[Basis]] element of the [[Product Topoplogy]] on $X$ [[cartesian product]] $Y$. Then, $(U\times V)\cap(A\times B)$ is an arbitrary [[Basis]] element of the [[Subspace Topology]] of $A$ [[cartesian product]] $B$. 
> $(U\times V)\cap(A\times B) = (U\cap A)\times(V\cap B)$
> 
> which is an arbitrary [[Basis]] element of the [[Product Topoplogy]] on $A$ [[cartesian product]] $B$. As these two [[Topology]]s have the same [[Basis]], they are the same [[Topology]] by the [[Finer Bases Lemma]].
