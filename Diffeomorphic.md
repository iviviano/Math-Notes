Two [[Subset]]s of [[Euclidean Space]]s $X,Y$ are called *diffeomorphic* if there exists a [[Diffeomorphism]] between $X$ and $Y$.

>[!note]
>Two diffeomorphic spaces are essentially equivalent as abstract [[Topological Space]]s, they may just be differently situated in their surrounding [[Euclidean Space]]s
