```ad-def
Let $X$ be a a [[Simply Ordered Set]]; Assume $X$ has more than one element. Let [[Notation/basis|basis]] be the collection of [[Set]]s of types:
1. All [[Open Interval]]s $(a, b)$ in $X$.
2. All intervals of the form $[a_0, b)$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element (if any) of $X$
3. All intervals of the form $(a, b_0]$, where $b_0$ is the largest element (if any) of $X$

The collection [[Notation/basis|basis]] is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for a [[Topology]] on $X$, called the *order topology*.
