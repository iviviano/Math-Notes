> Let $X$ be a a [[Simply Ordered Set]] [[Set]]; Assume $X$ has more than one element. Let [[basis]] be the collection of [[Set]]s of types:
> 1. All [[Open Interval]]s $(a, b)$ in $X$.
> 2. All intervals of the form $[a_0, b)$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element (if any) of $X$
> 3. All intervals of the form $(a, b_0]$, where $b_0$ is the largest element (if any) of $X$
> 
> The collection [[basis]] is a [[Basis]] for a [[Topology]] on $X$, called the *order topology*.
