> [!thm]
> Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s; let $f:X\rightarrow Y$. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
> 1. $f$ is [[Continuous]]
> 2. For every [[Subset]] $A$ of $X$, $f($[[closure]]$)$[[subset]] $\bar{f(A)}$
> 3. For every [[Closed Set]] [[Set]] $B$ of $Y$, the [[Set]] $f$[[inverse]]$(B)$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$.
> 4. For each $x\in X$ and each [[Neighborhood]] $V$ of $f(x)$, there is a [[Neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U)$ [[subset]] $V$.

> [!proof]
> This theorem will be proved by showing the folling string of implications:
