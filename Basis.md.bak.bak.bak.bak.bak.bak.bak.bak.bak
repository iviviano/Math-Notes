> A [[Set]] $\mathcal{B}$ is a *basis* for a [[Topological Space]], [[topological space]] [[iff]] 
> 1. For each $x\in X$, there is at least one basis element containing $x$
> 2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3$[[subset]]$B_1$[[union]]$B_2$
> 
> The [[Topology]] generated by the basis $\mathcal{B}$ is defined where: A [[Subset]] U of X is [[Open Set]] in X if for each $x\in$U, there is a bases element B containing x with B[[subset]]U.
