```ad-def
Given a metrix $d$ on $X$ and $\epsilon > 0$, the set
$$B_d(x, \epsilon) = \{y\in X|d(x, y)< \epsilon\}$$
of all points whose distance from $x$ is less than $\epsilon$ is called the $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-*ball centered at $x$*.
```

```ad-not
A ball may be notated $B_d(x, \epsilon)$, $B(x, \epsilon)$, or $B_\epsilon(x)$.
