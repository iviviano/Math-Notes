>[!def]
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]]. The *exterior [[Algebra]]* on $V$ is defined as $$\Lambda(V^{*})=\Lambda^{0}(V^{*})\oplus\Lambda^{1}(V^{*})\oplus\cdots\oplus\Lambda^{k}(V^{*})$$where $k$ is the [[Dimension]] of $V$ and $\Lambda^{0}(V^{*})=\mathbb{R}$ is interpreted as the constant [[Function]]s on $V$. This is a non[[Commutative]] [[Algebra]] whose [[Identity of a Groupoid]] element is $1\in \Lambda^{0}(V^{*})$.

>[!note] 
>The [[Wedge Product]] of any element of $\mathbb{R}$ with any $p$-[[P-Tensor]] is just the usual scalar multiplication
