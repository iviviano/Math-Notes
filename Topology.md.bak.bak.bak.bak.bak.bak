``` ad-def
Let X be a nonempty [[Set]]. Then $T$ is a *topology* on X [[iff]] 
1. $\emptyset\in T$ and X $\in T$
2. Any [[Union]] of elements of $T$ is in $T$
3. Any finite [[Intersection]] of elements of $T$ is in $T$

Then [[topological space]] is a [[Topological Space]]. 
```

Note: A topology can be described by a [[Basis|Basis]] or [[Subbasis|Subbasis]].
