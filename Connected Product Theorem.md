>[!thm]
Let $\{X_{i}:i\in I\}$ be a [[Collection]] of [[Topological Space]]s. Then, if the [[Cartesian Product]] $X$ is given the [[Product Topology]], $X$ is [[Connected]] [[iff]] $X_i$ is [[Connected]] for all $i\in I$.

>[!note]
>This is probably not true if $X$ is given the [[Box Topology]], as the proof of the [[Dense Subsets of Product Spaces Lemma]] uses this fact.

>[!proof]
If $X$ is [[Connected]], then each $X_{i}$ is [[Connected]] as it is the [[Image Set]] [[Projection]] map.
