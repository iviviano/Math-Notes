>An important first [[Order of a DE]] [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] is the *decay equation*:$$\frac{dx}{dt}=\alpha(t)\cdot x$$for a [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $\alpha:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

>[!prop]
>The decay equation may solved with [[Separation of Variables]], giving the solution: $$x(t)=A\cdot e^{\int \alpha(t)dt}$$
