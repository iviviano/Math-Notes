mathLink: Fejér kernel
---
>[!def]
>The *Fejér kernel* is the [[Sequence]] $$F_{n}(s):=\sum_{j:|j|≤n}\left(1- \frac{|j|}{n}\right)\ e^{2\pi ijs},s\in \mathbb{R}$$

>[!note]
>This is a real valued sequence:

- $F_{n}$ gets more concentrated at the origin as $n$ increases. 
- $F_n$ is [[Even Function]]
- $F_{n}$ is non-negative
