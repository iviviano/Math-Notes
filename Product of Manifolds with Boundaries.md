>[!prop]
>The [[Cartesian Product]] of a [[Manifold with Boundary]] $X$ and [[Manifold]] (without boundary) $Y$ is another [[Manifold with Boundary]]. Furthermore:
>$$\partial(X\times Y)=X\times \partial Y$$
>and 
>$$\text{dim}(X\times Y)=\text{dim }X+\text{dim }Y$$

>[!note] 
>I think the order of the [[Cartesian Product]] does matter here
