>A *partially ordered set* is a pair $(S,≤)$ where $S$ is a [[Set]] and $≤$ is a [[Relation]] on the elements of $S$ that has the following properties for $x,y,z\in S:$
>1. $x≤x$ ([[Reflexivity]])
>2. $x≤y\land y≤x\implies x=y$ ([[Antisymmetry]])
>3. $x≤y\land y≤z\implies x≤z$ ([[Transitivity]])

Examples: 
1. $\mathbb{R}$ with $≤$
2. $\mathcal{P}(X)$ with $≤$ given by $\subseteq$ for any [[Set]] $X$
3.
