>[!thm]
>If $X$ is a [[Topological Space]] and $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[Subbasis]] for the [[Topology]] on $X$, then $X$ is [[Compactness]] [[iff]] every [[Cover]] by [[Set]]s from $\mathcal{S}$ has a finite [[Subcover]].

>[!proof]

The proof of the forward implication follows trivially from the definition of [[Compactness]].

Suppose that every [[Cover]] of $X$ by sets from $\mathcal{S}$ has a finite [[Subcover]]. Suppose $X$ is not [[Compactness]]. Let $\Gamma$ be the [[Collection]] of all [[Open Cover]]s of $X$ that do not omit a finite [[Subcover]]. 
>[!note] Note: as $X$ is not compact, $\Gamma$ is not empty
