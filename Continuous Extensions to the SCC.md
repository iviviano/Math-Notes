mathLink: continuous extensions to the Stone-Ceck compactification
---
>[!thm]
>If $X$ is [[Completely Regular]] and $Z$ is a [[Compactness]] [[Topological Space]], then every [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $\eta: X \rightarrow Z$ has a [[Continuous]] extension $\eta^{\beta}:\beta X \rightarrow Z$ where $\beta X$ is the [[Stone-Ceck Compactification]].

>[!proof]

If $\xi\in \beta X$, then let $\{x_{i}\}$ be a [[Net]] in $X$ such that $x_{i}\rightarrow \xi$. Since $Z$ is [[Compactness]], the [[Net]] $\eta(x_{i})$ has a [[Clusters]] point in $Z$. If $h\in C(Z)$, then $h(\eta(x_{i}))$ [[notation for clusters]] $h(z)$.
