>[!prop]
>Let $X$ be a [[Local Compactness]] [[Topological Space]].
>1. Both $C_{0}(X)$ and $C_{x}(X)$ are [[Subalgebra]]s of $C_{b}(X)$.
>2. [[Set of Continuous Functions that Vanish at Infinity]]$(X)$ is [[Closed Set]] in [[Vector Space of Continuous Bounded Functions]].
>3. [[Set of Continuous Functions with Compact Support]]$(X)$ is [[Dense]] in $C_{0}(X)$
