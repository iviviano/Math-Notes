>Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Then a [[Subset]] $E$ of $X$ is *dense* in $X$ if $\bar{E} = X$.
>Equivalently: A set $E$ is dense [[iff]] $X$ is the only [[Closed Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$ containing $E$.

>[!prop]
>A set $E$ is *dense* in $(X,T)$ [[iff]] for every $x\in X$ and every [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] $G$ of $X$ that contains $x$ [[Intersects]] $E$.

>[!proof]
>Let $E$ be [[Dense]] in $X$. If $x\in X$, $x\in \bar{E}=X$, so if $G\subseteq X$ with $G$ [[Open Set]] and $x\in G$, $G$ [[Intersects]] $E$ by the [[Open Sets Intersecting the Closure Intersect the Set Theorem]]. 
>Suppose for all $x\in X$, every [[Neighborhood]] of $x$ [[Intersects]] $E$. Then, $x$ is a ...


Examples:
1. $X$ is dense within itself
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ (as is $\mathbb{I=R-Q}$)
3.
