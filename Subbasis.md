```ad-def
A *subbasis* $\mathcal{S}$ for a [[Topology]] on $X$ is a collection of [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]]s of $X$ whose [[Set Theory/Union|Union]] equals $X$. The *topology generated by the subbasis* is the collection of all [[Set Theory/Union|Union]]s of finite [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]]s of elements of $\mathcal{S}$.
