>[!thm]
>The [[Set]] of [[Critical Value]]s of a [[Smooth]] [[Function]] of [[Manifold]]s $f:X \mapsto Y$ has [[Measure 0 on Manifolds]].

>[!note]
>Almost all values of $f$ are [[Regular Value]]s.

>[!note]
>Very different from the statement that almost all points in $X$ are [[Regular Point]]s (which is false).

>[!prop] Corollary
>The [[Regular Value]]s of any [[Smooth]] map $f:X \mapsto Y$ are [[Dense]] in $Y$. In fact, if $f_{t}:X_{i}\mapsto Y$ are any countable number of [[Smooth]] maps, then the points of $Y$ that are simultaneously [[Regular Value]]s for all of the $f_{t}$ are [[Dense]] in $Y$.
