>A *group* is a [[Semigroup]] with an [[Identity of a Groupoid]] where every element has an [[Inverse of a Groupoid Element]].

>A nonempty [[Set]] $G$ with a [[Binary Operation]] on $G$ is called a *group* if 
>1. There is an element $1\in G$ such that $a1=1a=a$ for all $a\in G$
>2. The [[Binary Operation]] is [[Associativity]]: for any elements $a,b,c\in G$, $a(bc)=(ab)c$
>3. Every element in $a$ has an [[Inverse of a Groupoid Element]] $b$ such that $ab=1=ba$.
