mathLink: functions from compact spaces are uniformly continuous
---
>[!thm]
>Let $(X,d_{X}),(Z,d_{Z})$ be [[Metric Space]]s. Then, if $X$ is [[Compactness]], $f:X \rightarrow Z$ is [[Uniform Continuity]]. 

>[!note]
>This is essentially the same as the statement that [[Continuous]] [[Function]]s on [[Closed Set]] intervals are [[Riemann Integrability]].
