>[!def]
>Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Let $A$ be a [[Subset]] of $X$. The *boundary* of $A$ is defined as:
>$$\partial A=\bar{A}\cap\overline{X-A}$$
>Equivalently:
>$$\partial A=\bar{A}-\text{ int }A$$

>[!not]
>The boundary of a [[Set]] $A$ is often denoted:
>$$\partial A$$
>or 
>$$\text{bd }A$$
