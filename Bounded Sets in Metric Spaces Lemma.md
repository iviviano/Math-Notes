>[!prop]
>Let $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric Space]]. Then,
>1. A [[Subset]] $A$ of $X$ is [[Bounded Metric Space]] [[iff]] for any $x\in A$, there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $$A\subseteq B_{d}(x,\epsilon)$$
>2. The [[Union]] of a finite number of [[Bounded Metric Space]] sets is [[Bounded Metric Space]]
>3. A [[Cauchy Sequence]] in $(X,d)$ is a [[Bounded Metric Space]] [[Set]]
