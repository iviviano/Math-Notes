>Let $\{x_{i}\}$ be a [[Net]] in a [[Topological Space]] $X$. We say that the net *converges* to $x\in X$ if for every [[Open Set]] [[Set]] $U$ containing $x$, there is an $i_{0}\in I$ such that $x_{i}\in U$ for $iâ‰¥i_{0}$.

>[!note]
>[[Sequence]] [[Converges (Sequence)]]nce is a special case of net convergence
