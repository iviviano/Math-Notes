Suppose $\phi:X \rightarrow Y$ is a [[Continuous]] map taking the basepoint $x_{0}\in X$ to the basepoint $y_{0}\in Y$ ($\phi:(X,x_{0})\rightarrow (Y,y_{0})$). Then, $\phi$ induces a homomorphism $\phi_{*}:\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\rightarrow \pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})$, defined by composing loops $f:[0,1]\rightarrow X$ based at $x_{0}$ with $\phi$: $\phi_{*}[f]=[\phi f]$.

>- $(\phi \psi)_{*}=\phi_{*}\psi_{*}$ 
>- the identity of $X$ onto $X$ induces the identity of the [[Fundamental Group]] of $X$ onto itself.
