mathLink: open sets intersecting the closure intersect the set theorem
---
> [!thm]
> Let $A$ be a [[Subset]] of the [[Topological Space]] $X$.
> 1. Then $x\in$ [[closure]] [[iff]] every [[Open Set]] set $U$ containing $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$ (Every [[Neighborhood]] of $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$)
> 2. Supposing the [[Topology]] of $X$ is given by a [[Basis]], then $x\in$ [[closure]] [[iff]] every [[Basis]] element $B$ containing $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$.

> [!proof]
> 1. Suppose $x\in\bar{A}$. Then $x$ is in every [[Closed Set]] set containing $A$. So, if an [[Open Set]] set $U$ contains $x$, its [[Compliment]] does not contain $A$, so $U$ [[Intersects]] $A$.
> Suppose every [[Open Set]] set containing $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$. Then, no [[Closed Set]] set containing $A$ does not contain $x$. Therefore, $x\in$ [[closure]]

> 2. Suppose $x\in\bar{A}$. Then, every [[Basis]] element containing $x$ is an [[Open Set]] set containing $x$, so it [[Intersects]] $A$ by (1). Suppose every [[Basis]] element $B$ containing $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$. Every open set containing $x$ contains a [[Basis]] element $B$ containing $x$. Therefore, every [[Open Set]] set containing $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$, so $x\in\bar{A}$ by (1)
