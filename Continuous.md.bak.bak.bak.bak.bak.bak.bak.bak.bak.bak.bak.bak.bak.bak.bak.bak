> Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s. A [[Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be *continuous* if for each [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] $V$ of $Y$, the [[Set]] $U = f$[[inverse]]$(V)$ is an [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$.

Note: 
- Continuity depends not only on $f$ but on the [[Topology]]s of its [[Domain]] and [[Range]]. 
- A function can also be [[Continuity at a Point]] $x\in X$.  
- Continuity can also be defined in terms of the [[Preimage|Preimage]]s of [[Basis|Basis]] elements: [[Basis Formulation of Continuity]].
