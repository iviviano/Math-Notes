Let $X$ be a [[Smooth]] [[Manifold]] with or without boundary. A *$p$-form* on $X$ is a [[Function]] $\omega$ that assigns to each point $x\in X$ an [[Alternating Tensor]] $p$-[[P-Tensor]] $\omega(x)$ on the [[Tangent Space]] of $X$ at $x$: $$\omega(x)\in \Lambda^{p}[T_{x}(X)^{*}]$$

>[!note]
>Two $p$-forms on $X$ may be added point by point to obtain a new $p$-form $\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}$:$$(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})(x)=\omega_{1}(x)+\omega_{2}(x)$$

>[!note]
>Similarly, the [[Wedge Product]] is defined point by point. 

>[!note]
>$0$-forms are just arbitrary real-valued [[Function]]s on $X$.
