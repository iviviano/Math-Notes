>If $(X_{1},d_{1})$ and $(X_{2},d_{2})$ are [[Metric Space]]s, then, we can define a new metric space $(X_{1})$ [[notation for cartesian product]] $X_{2},d)$ by letting 
>$$d((x_{1},x_{2}), (y_{1},y_{2}))=d_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})+d_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})$$
>for all $x_{1},y_{1}\in X_{1}$ and $x_{2},y_{2}\in X_{2}$.

Note: the [[Metric]] $d$ induces the [[Product Topology]] on $X_{1}\times X_{2}$.
