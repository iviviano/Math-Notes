>[!thm]
>Suppose that $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a [[Submersion]] of at $x$, and $y=f(x)$. Then there exist [[Local]] [[Coordinate System]]s around $x$ and $y$ such that $$f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{l})$$So, $f$ is [[Local]]ly [[Equivalent Functions]] to the [[Canonical Submersion]] near $x$.

>[!note]
>Valuable implication for the geometric nature of solutions to functional equations.
