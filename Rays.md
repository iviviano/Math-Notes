```ad-def
If $X$ is an [[Ordered Set]], and $a\in X$, there are four [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]]s of $X$ that are called the *rays* of $X$ determined by $a$. They are:
$$(a, +\infty) = \{x|x>a\}$$
$$(-\infty, a) = \{x|x<a\}$$
$$[a, +\infty) = \{x|x\ge a\}$$
$$(-\infty, a] = \{x|x\le a\}$$

The first two are the *open rays*, and the second two are the *closed rays*.
```

Note: The open rays form a [[Subbasis]] for the [[Order Topology]]
