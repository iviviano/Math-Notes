mathLink: maps into products theorem

> [!thm]
> Let $f:A\rightarrow X$ [[cartesian product]] $Y$ bee given by the [[Rule of Assignment]]:
> $$f(a) = (f_1(a), f_2(a))$
> 
> Then, $f$ is [[Continuous]] [[iff]] the [[Function]]s
> $f_1:A\rightarrow X\text{   and   }f_2 :A\rightarrow Y$

> are [[Continuous]]. The maps $f_1$ and $f_2$ are called the *coordinate functions* of $f$.

> [!proof]
> Assume the coordinate functions are continuous. Then, if $V_1$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$ and $V_2$ is [[Open Set]] in $Y$, the set 
> $U = f^{-1}(V_1\times V_2) = f_1^{-1}(V_1)\cup f_2^{-1}(V_2)$

> Suppose $f$ is [[Continuous]], and let $V_1 \times V_2$ be [[Open Set]] in $X\times Y$. Then,
