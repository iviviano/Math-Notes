mathLink: unions of overlapping pathwise connected sets are pathwise connected
---
>[!prop]
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]].
>1. If $X$ is [[Pathwise Connectedness]], $X$ is [[Connected]].
>2. If $X$ is [[Pathwise Connectedness]] and $Y$ is another [[Topological Space]] such that there is a [[Continuous]] [[Surjective]] [[Function]] $f:X \rightarrow Y$, then $Y$ is [[Pathwise Connectedness]].
>3. If $\{E_{i}:i\in I\}$ is a [[Collection]] of [[Pathwise Connectedness]] [[Set]]s such that $E_{i}\cap E_{j}\ne\emptyset$ for all $i,j\in I$, then $E=\bigcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$ is [[Pathwise Connectedness]].
>4. If $\{E_{n}:n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Pathwise Connectedness]] [[Set]]s such that $E_{n}\cap E_{n+1}$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, then $E=\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}E_{n}$ is [[Pathwise Connectedness]].
