```ad-def
Let $X$ be a [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]; let $\{x_n\}$ be a [[Sequence]] in $X$. We say $x_n$ *converges* to $x$ if for each [[Neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$:
$$\exists N\in\mathbb{N}: x_n\in U\text{ for all } n \ge N$$
```

Note: in $\mathbb{R}$, a sequence cannot converge to more than one point, but in arbitrary spaces, it can!

Notation: $x_n$ [[notation for converges]] $x$
