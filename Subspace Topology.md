```ad-def
Let $X$ be a [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]] with [[Topology]] $T$. If $Y$ is a [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] of $X$, the collection
$$T_Y=\{Y\cap U|U\in T\}$$

is a [[Topology]] on Y, called the *subspace topology*. With this topology, Y is called [[Subspace]] of $X$; its open sets consist of all [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]]s of [[Open Set]] sets of $X$ with $Y$.
