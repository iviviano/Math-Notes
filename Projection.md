```ad-def
Let $\pi_1:X$[[Notation/cartesian product|cartesian product]] $Y \rightarrow X$ be defined by
$$\pi_1(x, y)=x$$

Let $\pi_2:X$ [[Notation/cartesian product|cartesian product]] $Y\rightarrow Y$ be defined by
$$\pi_2(x, y)=y$$

The maps $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are called the *projections* of $X$ [[Notation/cartesian product|cartesian product]] $Y$ onto its first and second factors, respectively.
```

Note: 
1. $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are [[Surjective]] unless $X$ or $Y$ is empty
2. if $U$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$, then $\pi_1^-1(U)$ is precisely $U$ [[notation for cartesian product|notation for cartesian product]] $Y$, which is open in the [[Product Topoplogy]]
