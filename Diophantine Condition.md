>[!def]
>An irrational number $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$ is said to satisfy a *Diophantine condition* with exponent $r>0$ if there exists a constant $\kappa>0$ such that $$\left|e^{2\pi in \alpha}-1\right|\ge \frac{\kappa}{|n|^{r}},\text{ for all }n\in\mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$$We write $$\alpha\in\mathcal{DC}(r)$$
