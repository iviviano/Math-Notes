> [!def]
> Given a [[Subset]] $A$ of a [[Topological Space]] [[topological space]], the *interior* of $A$ is defined as the [[Union]] of all [[Open Set]]s contained in $A$.

Notation: [[notation for interior]] $A$

> [!prop]
> If $A$ is [[Open Set]], $A$ = [[interior]] $A$.

Note: for category theory, equivalent to [[and]], [[Intersection|Intersection]], [[infinum]], and the smallest [[Topology]] contained in every element of a collection of [[Topology]]s
