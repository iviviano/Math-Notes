mathLink: basis for the product topology theorem
---
``` ad-thm
Suppose the [[Topology]] on each [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]] $X_\alpha$ is given by a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$. The collection of all sets of the form:
$$\prod_{\alpha\in J} B_\alpha$$
where $B_\alpha\in\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, will serve as a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Box Topology]] on the [[Product Space]]. 
The collection of all sets of the same form, where $B_\alpha\in\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ for finitely many indices $\alpha$ and $B_\alpha = X_\alpha$ for the remaining indices, will serve as a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]] on the [[Product Space]].
```

Question: is the basis above the same as: $\prod \mathcal{B}_\alpha$?

```ad-proof
Box Topology:
Consider the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] [[Notation/basis|basis]] for the [[Box Topology]] from its definition, and the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] [[Notation/basis|basis]]$'$ given above. Let $\mathbf{x}\in\prod X_\alpha$ be given. Let $B\in\mathcal{B}$ with $\mathbf{x}\in B$. For each $\alpha$, $B_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$, so pick $B'_\alpha\in\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ with $x_\alpha\in B'_\alpha$ and $B'_\alpha$ [[Notation/subset|subset]] $B_\alpha$ ([[Characterize Basis Lemma]]). Then, 
$$B'=\prod B'_\alpha\subseteq B$$
so, the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ is [[Topology/Finer|Finer]] than the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}$ by the [[Finer Bases Lemma]]. 

Let $B'\in\mathcal{B}'$ be given with $\mathbf{x}\in B'$. For each $\alpha$, $B'_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ as it is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] element for the [[Topology]] on $X_\alpha$. Therefore,
$$B=\prod B'_\alpha = B'$$
is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] element for $\mathcal{B}$, so the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is [[Topology/Finer|Finer]] than the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ by the [[Finer Bases Lemma]].

[[therefore]] the $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}'$ are bases for the same topology, so $\mathcal{B}$ is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Box Topology]].

Product Topology:
Consider the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] [[Notation/basis|basis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]] from the [[Comparison of the Box and Product Topologies Theorem]], and the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] [[Notation/basis|basis]]$'$ given above. Let $\mathbf{x}\in\prod X_\alpha$ be given. Let $B\in\mathcal{B}$ with $\mathbf{x}\in B$ be given. Note: $B_\alpha \ne X_\alpha$ for only finitely many $\alpha$. For such $\alpha$, note that $B_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$, and pick $B'_\alpha\in\mathcal{B}'_\alpha$ with $x_\alpha\in B'_\alpha$ ([[Characterize Basis Lemma]]). For other $\alpha$, let $B'_\alpha = X_\alpha$. Then, 
$$B'=\prod B'_\alpha\subseteq B$$
As $B'_\alpha \ne X_\alpha$ for only finitely many $\alpha$, $B_\alpha\in\mathcal{B'_\alpha}$, so the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ is [[Topology/Finer|Finer]] than the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}$ by the [[Finer Bases Lemma]].

That the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is [[Topology/Finer|Finer]] than the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ is again trivially true.

[[therefore]] $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}'$ are bases for the same [[Topology]], so $\mathcal{B}$ is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]].
