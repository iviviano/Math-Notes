> If [[topological space]] is a [[Topological Space]] and $x\in X$, we say $x$ is a *limit point* of $A$ if every [[Neighborhood]] of $x$ [[Intersects]] $A$ at some point other than $x$ itself:
> $\forall U\in T: x\in U: (A - \{x\})\cap U \ne \emptyset$
> 
> Equivalently, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if it belongs to the [[Closure]] of $A - \{x\}$.
