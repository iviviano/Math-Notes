> [!def]
> If $X$ is an [[Ordered Set]], and $a\in X$, there are four [[Subset]]s of $X$ that are called the *rays* of $X$ determined by $a$. They are:
> $(a, +\infty) = \{x|x>a\}$
> $(-\infty, a) = \{x|x<a\}$
> $[a, +\infty) = \{x|x\ge a\}$
> $(-\infty, a] = \{x|x\le a\}$
> 
> The first two are the *open rays*, and the second two are the *closed rays*.

Note: The open rays form a [[Subbasis]] for the [[Order Topology]]
