>If $X$ is a [[Topological Space]], then a *partition of unity* is a [[Collection]] of [[Continuous]] [[Function]]s $\{\phi_{i}:i\in I\}$ with the following properties:
>1. $\phi_{i}:X \mapsto [0,1]$ for all $i\in I$.
>2. The [[Collection]] $\{\{x\in X:\phi_{i}(x)>0\}:i\in I\}$ is a [[Locally Finite]] [[Open Cover]] of $X$.
>3. For every $x\in X$, $\sum \phi_{i}(x)=1$.
