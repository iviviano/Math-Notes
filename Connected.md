>Let $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric Space]]. Then, $X$ is *connected* if no [[Subset]]s of $X$ are both [[Closed Set]] and [[Open Set]] besides $X$ and $\emptyset$. If $E\subseteq X$, $E$ is *connected* if the [[Metric Space]] $(E,d)$ is *connected*.

>$X$ is *connected* whenever $X=A\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are both [[Open Set]] or both [[Closed Set]], and $A\cap B=\emptyset$, then $A=\emptyset$ or $B=\emptyset$.
