Let $X$ be a $k$-dimensional [[Manifold]] and $x\in X$. Suppose $X$ sits in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and that $\phi:U \rightarrow X$ is a [[Local]] [[Parameterization]] around $x$ where $U$ is [[Open Set]] in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $\phi(0)=x$ for convenience. The best [[Linear]] approximation to $\phi$ at $0$ is the map:
$$u \rightarrow \phi(0)+d\phi_{0}(u)=x+d \phi_{0}(u)$$
The *tangent space* of $X$ at $x$ is the [[Image Set]] of the [[Function]] $d \phi_{0}:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N}$.
