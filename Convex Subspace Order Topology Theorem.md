mathLink: convex subspaces inherit the order topology
---
```ad-thm
Let $X$ be an [[Ordered Set]] in the [[Order Topology]]; let $Y$ be a [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] of $X$ that is [[Convex]] in $X$. Then the [[Order Topology]] on $Y$ is the same as the [[Topology]] $Y$ inherits as a [[Subspace]] of $X$.
