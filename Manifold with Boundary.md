>A [[Subset]] $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is a *$k$-dimensional [[Manifold]] with [[Boundary]]* if every point of $X$ possesses a [[Neighborhood]] [[Diffeomorphic]] to an [[Open Set]] set in the [[Topological Space]] $H^{k}$, the [[Upper-Half Space]].

>[!note]
>The [[Boundary]] of $X$ consists of all points that belong to the [[Image]] of the [[Boundary]] of $H^{k}$ under some [[Local]] [[Parameterization]]. Its [[Compliment]] is called the [[Interior]] of $X$: $\text{int }X=X-\partial X$.
