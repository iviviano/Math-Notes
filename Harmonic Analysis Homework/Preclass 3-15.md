>[!Experiment 1]

At max speaker volume, the lowest frequency sound I could hear was $55\ \text{Hz}$. As I increased the frequency, the perceived volume also increased. 
I noticed that the pitch didn't increase linearly with frequency, rather, the intervals seemed closer together as frequency got higher. The change in volume was also non-linear. It was very easy to perceive the volume differences between frequencies of $55\ \text{Hz}$ to $100\ \text{Hz}$ or $150\ \text{Hz}$. But, I could barely hear a difference in volume between $500\ \text{Hz}$ and $1000\ \text{Hz}$.

1. I hear a quiet, low buzz
2. This is much louder with the same pitch. This is consistent with [[Plancherel's Identity]], since the complex tone has [[Fourier Coefficient]]s $\hat f_{1}$ and $\hat f_{2}$ nonzero. Switching off $\nu_{1}$ increases the pitch by one octave. It also seems to increase the volume, which must be related to the relationship between loudness and pitch observed in the first experiment.
3. Wow, it worked! Interestingly, the loudness increased when tone 1 was switched off.
4. I didn't notice anything different in the complex tone when adding them in different orders. Adjusting the volume of tone 3 while keeping the volume of tone 2 fixed (and tone 1 off) seemed to change the pitch. When the volume of 3 was less than that of tone 2, I would hear two distinct pitches -- tone 2 by itself and tone 1. There was an analogous phenomenon when the volume of tone 2 was fixed and tone 3 was varied. This time, the distinct pitches were tone 3 by itself and tone 2.
5. Cool!
