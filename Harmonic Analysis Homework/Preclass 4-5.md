1. Return times: $\{1,2,5,12,41,53\}$
2. $$\begin{align*}
1:&\text{ overshoot}\\
2:&\text{ undershoot}\\
5:&\text{ overshoot}\\
12:&\text{ undershoot}\\
41:&\text{ overshoot}\\
53:&\text{ undershoot}
\end{align*}$$
3. The orbit jumps around the circle. We can think of a current distance $d$, where all new points are added $d$ away from an existing point. Once all of the points on the circle are within $d$ of each other, we decrease $d$ and repeat.
4. The circle fills out very quickly for large $n$.
