When whistling or singing, I produced a sine wave. I noticed that the signal was significantly "smoother" when whistling. The peaks were better defined â€“ less noisy and rounder. The peaks were also closer together for whistling pitches. I think this means that my whistling range is higher pitch than my singing range. I'm interested in what the smoothness difference comes from. It could be sensitivity difference based on the input frequency or just an indicator of my poor singing. The noises like clapping or snapping looked very different. The signal was a jagged spike at a certain time. It looked like the sum of several sine waves with differing amplitudes and frequencies. The smoothness of the signal was a lot more like my singing than whistling.
