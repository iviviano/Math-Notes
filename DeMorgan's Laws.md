```ad-thm
For [[Set]]s A, B, C:
A - B $\bigcup$ C = (A - B) $\bigcap$ (A - C)
A - B $\bigcap$ C = (A - B) $\bigcup$ (A - C)
The [[Set Theory/Compliment|Compliment]] of the [[Set Theory/Union|Union]] equals the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] of the [[Set Theory/Compliment|Compliment]]s
The [[Set Theory/Compliment|Compliment]] of the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] equals the [[Set Theory/Union|Union]] of the [[Set Theory/Compliment|Compliment]]s
