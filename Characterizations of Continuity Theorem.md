```ad-thm
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]s; let $f:X\rightarrow Y$. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
1. $f$ is [[Continuous]]
2. For every [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] $A$ of $X$, $f($[[Notation/closure|closure]]$)$[[Notation/subset|subset]] $\bar{f(A)}$
3. For every [[Closed Set]] [[Set]] $B$ of $Y$, the [[Set]] $f$[[Notation/inverse|inverse]]$(B)$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$.
4. For each $x\in X$ and each [[Neighborhood]] $V$ of $f(x)$, there is a [[Neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U)$ [[Notation/subset|subset]] $V$.
```

```ad-proof
This theorem will be proved by showing the folling string of implications:
