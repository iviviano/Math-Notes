Let $G_{1},G_{2}$ be [[Group]]s. Define a [[Group]] on $G=G_{1}\times G_{2}$ by $$(g_{1},g_{2})\cdot(h_{1},h_{2})=(g_{1}h_{1},g_{2}h_{2})$$for any $(g_{1},g_{2})$ and $(h_{1},h_{2})$ in $G$. The [[Identity of a Groupoid]] of $G$ is $e=(e_{1},e_{2})$, and the [[Inverse of a Groupoid Element]]s are given by $$(g_{1},g_{2})^{-1}=(g_{1}^{-1},g_{2}^{-1})$$Then, $G$ is a [[Group]] called the *direct product* of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.
