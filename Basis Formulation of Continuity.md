```ad-prop
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]s, and suppose the [[Topology]] of $Y$ is given by a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] [[Notation/basis|basis]]. A [[Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is [[Continuous]] if for each [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] element $B$ of [[Notation/basis|basis]], the [[Set]] $U = f$[[Notation/inverse|inverse]]$(B)$ is an [[Open Set]] [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] of $X$.
```

```ad-proof
Let $V$ be an [[Open Set]] [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] of $Y$. Then, $V$ can be written as a [[Set Theory/Union|Union]] of [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] elements 
$$V = \bigcup B_\alpha$$
$$f^{-1}(V) = \bigcup f^{-1}(B_\alpha)$$
as [[Union Under Inverse Image]]. As the [[Set Theory/Preimage|Preimage]] of each basis element is [[Open Set]], the [[Set Theory/Union|Union]] of [[Open Set]] sets is [[Open Set]]. 
[[therefore]] $f$ is [[Continuous]].
```

```ad-prop:
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]s, and suppose the [[Topology]] of $Y$ is given by a [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] $\mathcal{S}$. A [[Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is [[Continuous]] if for each [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] element $S$ of $\mathcal{S}$, the [[Set Theory/Preimage|Preimage]] $U = f$[[Notation/inverse|inverse]]$(S)$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$.
```

```ad-proof
Let $B$ be a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] element of the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] generated by the [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] $\mathcal{S}$ of $Y$. Then, $B$ can be written as a finite [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] of [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] elements:
$$B = \bigcap S_\alpha$$
$$f^{-1}(B) = \bigcap f^{-1}(S_\alpha)$$
as [[Intersection Under Inverse Image]]. As the [[Set Theory/Preimage|Preimage]] of any [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] element is [[Open Set]], $f$ is [[Continuous]] by the previous lemma.
