```ad-def
Given an index set $J$, and given points $\mathbf{x} = (x_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in J}$ and $\mathbf{y}=(y_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in J}$ of $\mathbb{R}^J$, we define a [[Metric]] $\bar{\rho}$ on $\mathbb{R}^J$ by the equation
$$\bar{\rho}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\sup\{\bar{d}(x_\alpha,y_\alpha)|\alpha\in J\}$$
where $\sup$ is the [[Supremum]], and $\bar{d}$ is the [[Standard Bounded Metric]] on $\mathbb{R}$. $\bar{\rho}$ is called the *uniform metric* on $\mathbb{R}^J$.
