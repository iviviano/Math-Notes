What does it really mean to talk about a macroscopic particle?

Themes:
- Value of Planck's constant separates Quantum from Classical - $h \rightarrow 0$ limit makes every quantum phenomenon classical, that $h$ is small makes quantum effects only measurable for small systems
	- [[Quantum Uncertainty Principle]]
	- [[Photoelectric Effect]]
	- [[de Broglie Hypothesis]]
- Wave-particle duality is a symmetry unifies matter and radiation
	- EM waves just have particles with 0 rest mass
	- [[Quantum Uncertainty Principle]] prevents matter (or light) from displaying both particle-like and wave-like properties in the same experiment
