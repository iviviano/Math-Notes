$$\Delta x\cdot \Delta p\ge \frac{h}{4\pi}$$
We can derive this using the commutator for the Quantum position and momentum operators and the [[Uncertainty Principle]] of the [[Fourier Transform]].

Alternatively, we can think of the physical process of observing a particle. Then, the [[Uncertainty Principle]] comes from the Quantization of light and that at least one photon must be scattered by a particle for us to observe it.

We also have the energy-time formulation: $$\Delta E\cdot \Delta t\ge \frac{h}{4\pi}$$
This comes from the [[Uncertainty Principle]] and $$E=h \nu$$
