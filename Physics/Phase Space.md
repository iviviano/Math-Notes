For a physical system, the *phase space* represents all possible states. This usually corresponds to all possible values of [[position]] and [[momentum]] variables. Generally, each degree of freedom of the system is an axis in the phase space.

In [[Thermodynamics]], there is also a macroscopic parametrization of the system. This uses macroscopic variables like [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[volume]] to specify macrostates of the system.
