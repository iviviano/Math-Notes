We consider an additional Quantum postulate:

>[!ax] Correspondence Principle
>1. The predictions of the quantum theory for the behavior of any physical system must correspond to the prediction of classical physics in the limit in which the quantum numbers specifying the state of the system become very large
>2. A selection rule holds true over the entire range of the quantum number concerned. Any selection rules necessary to obtain the classical limit also apply in the quantum limit (small n).

(1) Obviously, the quantum theory must correspond to classical theory in the classical limit. The assumption of Bohr's correspondence principle is that the classical limit is large quantum numbers.
