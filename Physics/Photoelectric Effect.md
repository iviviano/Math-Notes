mathLink: photoelectric effect

>[!def]
The ejection of [[electron]]s from a surface by the action of [[light]] is called the *photoelectric effect*.

- First shown in experiments of [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1886
- ejected electrons have kinetic energy
	- measure this by applying voltage opposing their motion


Evidence for [[Quantum Mechanics]]:
- electric discharge between two electrodes occurs more readily when UV light falls on the electrode
- $K_{max}$ is independent of the Intensity of light
- minimum frequency for effect to occur ([[Millikan]] 1914)
- no "lag" where the electrons are absorbing energy from the beam of light, effect instant even for low intensity light
