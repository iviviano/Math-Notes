mathLink: closure in subspace theorem
---
> [!thm]
> Let $Y$ be a [[Subspace]] of $X$. Let $A$ be a [[Subset]] of $Y$. Let [[closure]] denote the [[Closure]] of $A$ in $X$. Then, the [[Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$ equals [[closure]] [[intersection]] $Y$.

Note: in the situation above, [[notation for closure]] refers to the [[Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $X$, which is generally different than the [[Closure|Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$. 

> [!proof]
> The [[Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$ is the [[Intersection]] of all [[Closed Set]] sets in $Y$ containing $A$. Any [[Closed Set]] set in $Y$ can be written as the [[Intersection]] of a [[Closed Set]] set in $X$ with $Y$ by the [[Closed Sets in Subspace Theorem]]. By the comutativity and associativity of the [[Intersection]], the [[Closure]] of $A$ in $Y$ is the [[Intersection]] of all closed sets in $X$ containing $A$ [[Intersection]]ed with $Y$.
