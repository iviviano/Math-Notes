>A [[P-Tensor]] $T$ is *alternating* if the sign of $T$ is reversed whenever two variables are transposed: $$T(v_{1},\ldots,v_{i},\ldots,v_{j},\ldots,v_{p})=-T(v_{1},\ldots,v_{j},\ldots,v_{i},\ldots,v_{p})$$

>[!note]
>For a [[Permutation]] $\pi\in S_{n}$ the [[Symmetric Group]], let $(-1)^\pi=1$ if $\pi$ is [[Even Permutation]] and $-1$ if $\pi$ is [[Odd Permutation]]. For any $p$-[[P-Tensor]] $T$, we can define another $p$-tensor $T^\pi$ by $$T^\pi(v_{1},\ldots,v_{p})=T(v_{\pi(1)},\ldots,v_{\pi(p)})$$Clearly, the alternating $p$-tensors are those satisfying $$T^\pi=(-1)^{\pi}T \text{ for all }\pi\in S_{p}$$from the characterization of [[Even Permutation]] or [[Odd Permutation]] based on number of simple transpositions.
