>[!thm]
>Assume that $f:V \rightarrow U$ is an [[Orientation-Preserving]] [[Diffeomorphism]] of [[Open Set]] [[Set]]s in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or $H^{n}$ and let $\omega$ be an [[Integrable Form]] on $U$. Then, $$\int_{U}\omega=\int_{V}f^{*}\omega$$If $f$ reverses orientation, then $$\int_{U}\omega=-\int_{V}f^{*}\omega$$
