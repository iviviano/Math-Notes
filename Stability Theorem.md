>[!thm]
>The following classes of [[Smooth]] [[Function]]s of a [[Compactness]] [[Manifold]] $X$ into a [[Manifold]] $Y$ are [[Stable Class]]es:
>1. [[Local]] [[Diffeomorphism]]s
>2. [[Immersion]]s
>3. [[Submersion]]s
>4. maps [[Transversal Theorem]] to any specified [[Submanifold]] $Z\subseteq Y$.
>5. [[Embedding]]s
>6. [[Diffeomorphism]]s

>[!note]
>This justifies the [[Dimension]]al exclusion of [[Transversal Submanifold]] given as a note in the [[Transversal Theorem]] as in that case, there is a small perturbation that pulls $f$ off $Z$ immediately and thus the intersection is not stable.
>
>It actually justifies any nontranversal intersections.
