> [!prop]
> Let [[basis]] and [[basis]]' be bases for the [[Topology]]s $T$ and $T'$ on $X$. Then the following are equivalent.
> 1. $T'$ is [[Finer]] than $T$
> 2. $\forall x\in X$ and each [[Basis]] element $B\in\mathcal{B}$ containing $x$, there is a basis element $B'\in\mathcal{B'}$ such that $x\in B'\subseteq B$.
