>[!thm]
>The [[Exterior Derivative]] [[Operator]] $d$ has the following three properties:
>1. Linearity: $$d(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})=d \omega_{1}+d \omega_{2}$$
>2. The multiplication law: $$d(\omega\land \theta)=(d \omega)\land \theta+(-1)^{p}\omega\land d \theta$$where $\omega$ is a $p$-[[P-Form]]
>3. The cocycle condition:$$d(d \omega)=0$$

>[!thm]
>The [[Exterior Derivative]] [[Operator]] defined for [[P-Form]]s on arbitrary [[Manifold with Boundary]]s has properties above and:
>1. If $f$ is a [[Function]], $df$ is the same as the [[Global Derivative Map]]
>2. If $g:X \rightarrow Y$ is a [[Diffeomorphism]], then $d\circ g^{*}=g^{*}\circ d$
>3. If $g:Y \rightarrow X$ is a [[Smooth]] map of [[Manifold with Boundary]]s, then for every [[P-Form]] $\omega$ on $X$, $d(g^{*}\omega)=g^{*}(d \omega)$.
