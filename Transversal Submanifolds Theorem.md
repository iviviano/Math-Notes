>[!thm]
>The [[Intersection]] of two [[Transversal Submanifold]] [[Submanifold]]s of $Y$ is again a [[Submanifold]]. Moreover, $$\text{codim}(X\cap Z)=\text{codim }X+\text{codim }Z$$

>[!note]
>If the [[Dimension]]s of $X$ and $Z$ do not add up to at least the [[Dimension]] of $Y$, the can only intersect [[Transversal Submanifold]]ly by not intersecting at all.
