>[!thm]
Let $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric Space]], let $K$ be a [[Closed Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$. Then the following are equivalent:
>1. $K$ is [[Compactness]].
>2. If $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of [[Subset]]s of $K$ having the [[Finite Intersection Property]], then $\bigcap_{F\in \mathcal{F}}F\ne \emptyset$
>3. Every [[Sequence]] in $K$ has a [[Converges (Sequence)]]nt [[Subsequence]].
>4. Every infinite [[Subset]] of $K$ has a [[Limit Point]].
>5. $(K,d)$ is a [[Complete]] [[Metric Space]] that is [[Totally Bounded]].
