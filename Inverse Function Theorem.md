>[!thm]
Suppose that $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a [[Smooth]] [[Function]] whose [[Derivative]] $df_{x}$ at the point $x$ is an [[Isomorphism]]. Then, $f$ is [[Diffeomorphic]] at $x$.

>[!note] 
>If two [[Function]]s have the same [[Tangent Space]] at a point (or at least they are [[Isomorphic]]), then they are [[Diffeomorphic]] at that point.
