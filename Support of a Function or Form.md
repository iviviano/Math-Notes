A [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $f:X \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, the *support* of $f$ is defined to be $$\text{spt }f=\text{cl }\{x\in X:f(x)≠0\}$$

>[!def]
>Let $\omega$ be a [[Smooth]] $k$-[[P-Form]] on $X$, a $k$-dimensional [[Manifold with Boundary]]. The *support* of $\omega$ is defined as the [[Closure]] of the [[Set]] of points for which $\omega(x)≠0$.
