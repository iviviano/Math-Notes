>Let $X,Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s. We say that two [[Smooth]] [[Function]]s $f_{0},f_{1}:X \mapsto Y$ are *homotopic* if there exists a [[Smooth]] map $F:X\times[0,1]:Y$ such that $F(x,0)=f_{0}(x)$ and $F(x,1)=f_{1}(x)$.
> 
Then there is a [[Smooth]]ly evolving family of maps $f_{t}:X \mapsto Y$ where $f_{t}(x)=F(x,t)$.

>[!note]
>Homotopic is an [[Equivalence Relation]] on [[Smooth]] maps from $X$ to $Y$.
