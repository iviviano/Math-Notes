>For any [[Topological Space]], every [[Connected]] [[Set]] is contained in a [[Connected Component]], distinct [[Connected Component]]s are [[Disjoint]], and the [[Union]] of all [[Connected Component]]s is the entire [[Topological Space]].

Let $A$ be [[Connected]]. Assume $A$ is not contained in a [[Connected Component]]. Then, ...


Let $A,B$ be [[Connected Component]]s. Suppose they are not [[Disjoint]]. Then, $A\cup B$ is [[Connected]] as [[Unions of Overlapping Connected Sets are Connected]]. But $A,B$ are [[Maximal]], so no [[Connected]] [[Set]] properly contains $A$ or $B$. [[therefore]] $A=B=\emptyset$.
