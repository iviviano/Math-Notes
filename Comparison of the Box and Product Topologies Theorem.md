```ad-thm
The [[Box Topology]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ has as [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] all [[Set]]s of the form $\prod U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. The [[Product Topoplogy]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ has as [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] all sets of the form $\prod U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$ and $U_\alpha$ equals $X_\alpha$ except for finitely many values of $\alpha$.

```ad-thm
The statement about the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for the [[Box Topology]] is true by definition.
Consider the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] generated by the [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]]. Let 
$$\mathcal{S} = \{\pi_\alpha^{-1}(U_\alpha) : U_\alpha \text{ is open in } X_\alpha\}$$
be a the [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] for the [[Product Topoplogy]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ ([[Subbasis for the Product Topology Theorem]]). Let [[Notation/basis|basis]] be the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] generated by [[Notation/subbasis|subbasis]]. Then, $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is a finite [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]]s of elements of [[Notation/subbasis|subbasis]]. Particularly, $B_\alpha$ is a finite [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]]s of [[Open Set]]s sets of $X_\alpha$, so it is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ (the $\alpha$th component of each [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] element is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$). [[therefore]] The [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] described above is a [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] of [[Notation/basis|basis]] (Almost correct reasoning). 
Let $B = \prod U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ and $U_\alpha$ equals $X_\alpha$ except for finitely many $\alpha$. Let $J = \{\alpha: U_\alpha \ne X_\alpha\}$. $J$ is finite. As $B_\alpha$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, $\pi_\alpha^{-1}(B_\alpha)\in$ [[Notation/subbasis|subbasis]]. 
$$B = \bigcup_{\alpha\in J}\pi_\alpha^{-1}(B_\alpha)$$
so, $B$ is in the [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] generated by the [[Topology/Subbasis|Subbasis]] [[Notation/subbasis|subbasis]].
[[therefore]] the two bases are equal

The [[Box Topology]] is [[Topology/Finer|Finer]] than the [[Product Topoplogy]].
