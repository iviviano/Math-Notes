>[!thm]
>Let $X$ be any [[Subset]] of $\mathbb{R}^N$. For any [[Cover]] of $X$ by relatively [[Open Set]] [[Subset]]s $\{U_\alpha\}$, there exists a [[Sequence]] of [[Smooth]] [[Function]]s $\{\theta_i\}$ on $X$, called a [[Partition of Unity]] [[Subordinate to the Cover]] $\{U_\alpha\}$ with the following properties:
>1. $0≤\theta_{i}(x)≤1$ for all $x\in X$ and all $t$.
>2. Each $x\in X$ has a [[Neighborhood]] on which all but finitely many [[Function]]s $\theta_i$ are indentically $0$.
>3. Each [[Function]] $\theta_{t}$ is identically zero except on some [[Closed Set]] [[Set]] contained in one of $U_\alpha$.
>4. For each $x\in X$, $$\sum_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\theta_{i}(x)=1$$

>[!prop] Corollary 
>On any [[Manifold]] $X$, there exists a [[Proper Map]] map $\rho: X \mapsto \mathbb{R}$.
