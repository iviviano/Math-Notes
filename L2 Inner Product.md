>[!def]
>The $L^{2}$-[[Inner Product]] is defined by $$\langle f,g\rangle_{2}:= \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\overline{f(t)}\ g(t)\ dt$$

>[!prop]
>$\langle.,.\rangle$ is an [[Inner Product]] on $\mathcal{C}_{1}(\mathbb{R};\mathbb{C})$ and a [[Semidefinite Inner Product]] [[Inner Product]] on $\mathcal{R}_{1}(\mathbb{R};\mathbb{C})$

>[!note]
The [[Induced Norm]] $L^{2}$ norm is the sound intensity of a wave, which is proportional to its loudness
