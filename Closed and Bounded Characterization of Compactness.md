mathLink: closed and bounded characterization of compactness proposition

>[!prop]
Let $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric Space]]. Then,
>1. If $K\subseteq X$ is [[Compactness]], then $K$ is [[Closed Set]] and [[Bounded Metric Space]]. (Special case: [[Heine-Borel Theorem]])
>2. If $K\subseteq X$ is [[Compactness]] and $F\subset K$ is [[Closed Set]], $F$ is [[Compactness]]
>3. [[Continuous]] [[Function]]s map [[Compactness]] [[Set]]s to compact sets ([[Extreme Value Theorem]])
