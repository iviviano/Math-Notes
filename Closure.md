> [!def]
> Given a [[Subset]] $A$ of a [[Topological Space]] $X$, the *closure* of $A$ is defined as the [[Intersection]] of all [[Closed Set]] sets containing $A$. 

> [!not]
> Notated as: [[notation for closure]] or Cl $A$

> [!prop]
> [[notation for interior]] $A$ [[notation for subset]] $A$ [[notation for subset]] [[notation for closure]].

> [!prop]
> If $A$ is [[Closed Set]], $A$ = [[notation for closure]]

Note: for category theory, equivalent to [[or]], [[Union|Union]], [[Supremum]], and the largest [[Topology]] containing a collection of [[Topology]]s
