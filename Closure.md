```ad-def
Given a [[Set Theory/Subset|Subset]] $A$ of a [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]] $X$, the *closure* of $A$ is defined as the [[Set Theory/Intersection|Intersection]] of all [[Closed Set]] sets containing $A$. 
```

```ad-not
Notated as: [[closure]] or Cl $A$
```

```ad-prop
[[interior]] $A$ [[Notation/subset|subset]] $A$ [[Notation/subset|subset]] [[closure]].
```

```ad-prop
If $A$ is [[Closed Set]], $A$ = [[closure]]
```

Note: for category theory, equivalent to [[or]], [[Union|Union]], [[Supremum]], and the largest [[Topology]] containing a collection of [[Topology]]s
