> [!def]
> Let $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in J}$ be an indexed family of sets; let $X$ = [[union]]$A_\alpha$. The *cartesian product* of this indexed family, denoted by 
> $\prod_{\alpha\in J}A_\alpha$
> is defined to be the set of all $J-$[[Tuple]]s $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_\alpha \in A_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in J$. Formally, it is the set of all [[Function]]s 
> $\mathbf{x}:J\rightarrow\bigcup A_\alpha$
> such that $\mathbf{x}(\alpha)\in A_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in J$.
