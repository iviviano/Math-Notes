>[!def]
For two [[Schwartz Function]] [[Function]]s $f,g\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R};\mathbb{C})$, the *$\mathcal{L}^{2}$-[[Inner Product]]* is defined by $$\langle f,g\rangle_{\mathcal{L}^{2}}:=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\overline{f(x)}\cdot g(x)\ dx$$

>[!note]
>This is an [[Inner Product]], since we assume $f,g$ are [[Continuous]].
