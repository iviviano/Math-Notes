>Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Then, $X$ is said to be *pathwise connected* if for any points $p,q\in X$, there is a [[Path]] in $X$ from $p$ to $q$. A [[Subset]] of $X$ is said to be *pathwise connected* if it is a *pathwise connected* [[Topological Space]] in the [[Subspace Topology]].

Examples:
1. $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is pathwise connected
2. $\mathbb{R}-\{0\}$ is not pathwise connected or [[Connected]]
3. $\mathbb{R}^{n}-\{p\}$ for $n>1$ is path connected
