>[!prop]
Consider the [[Metric Space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
>1. If $G$ is an [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then every [[Component]] of $G$ is [[Open Set]] and there are countably many [[Component]]s.
>2. An [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] $G$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is [[Connected]] [[iff]] for any $x,y\in G$ there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that there is an [[Ep Chain]] in $G$ from $x$ to $y$.
