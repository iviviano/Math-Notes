Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Let $\{f_{n}\},f$ be [[Bounded Function into R]] [[Function]]s from $X$ into $\mathbb{R}$. Then, it is said that $f_{n}$ *converges uniformly* to $f$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, there is an $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $nâ‰¥N$ and every $x\in X$, $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$.
