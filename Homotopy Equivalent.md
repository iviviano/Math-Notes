mathLink: homotopy equivalent

>[!def]
Two [[Topological Space]]s $X,Y$ are said to be *homotopy equivalent* if there are [[Homotopy Equivalences]]s $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y \rightarrow X$.

>[!note]
>Two spaces $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent [[iff]] there exists a third space $Z$ containing both $X$ and $Y$ as [[Deformation Retract]]s
