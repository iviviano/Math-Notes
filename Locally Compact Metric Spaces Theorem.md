>[!thm]
>If $(X,d)$ is a [[Local Compactness]] [[Metric Space]], then the following are equivalent:
>1. The [[One Point Compactification]] $X_{\infty}$ is [[Metrizable]].
>2. $X$ is [[Sigma-Compact]]
>3. The [[Metric Space]] [[Set of Continuous Functions that Vanish at Infinity]]$(X)$ is [[Separable]].

>[!prop] Corollary
>If $X$ is a [[Compactness]] [[Topological Space]], then [[Vector Space of Continuous Functions]]$(X)$ is [[Separable]] [[iff]] $X$ is a [[Compactness]] [[Metric Space]].
