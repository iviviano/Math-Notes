>A [[Topological Space]] $X$ is *normal* if for any pair of [[Disjoint]] [[Closed Set]] [[Subset]]s $A$ and $B$ there are [[Disjoint]] [[Open Set]] [[Set]]s $U$ and $V$ such that $A\subseteq U$ and $B\subseteq V$.

>[!note]
Normal [[Hausdorff Space]]s are [[Regular]], as all singletons are [[Closed Set]].
