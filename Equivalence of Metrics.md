>[!def]
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $d,\rho$ be [[Metric]]s on $X$. Then, $d$ and $\rho$ are said to be *equivalent* if they define the same [[Converges (Sequence)]]nt [[Sequence]]s. Equivalently, $d$ and $\rho$ are equivalent if the identity [[Function]]:
$$i:(X,d)\rightarrow(X,\rho)$$ is a [[Homeomorphism]].

>[!note]
>Two equivalent metrics do not necessarily have the same [[Cauchy Sequence]] sequences.

>[!prop]
For any [[Metric Space]] $(X,d)$,
$$\rho=\frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}$$
defines an equivalent metric.
