```ad-thm
Let $\{X_\alpha\}$ be an indexed family of [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]s; let $A_\alpha$ [[Notation/subset|subset]] $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. If $\prod X_\alpha$ is given either the [[Product Topoplogy]] or the [[Box Topology]], then
$$\prod \bar{A}_\alpha = \overline{\prod A_\alpha}$$
