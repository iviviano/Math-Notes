>A [[Function]] $T:V^{k}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is said to be *multilinear* if it is separately [[Linear]] in each variable. That is, holding all but the $j$th variable constant, we have the usual [[Linear]]ity condition: $$T(v_{1},\ldots,v_{j}+av_{j}',\ldots,v_{k})=T(v_{1},\ldots,v_{j},\ldots,v_{p})+aT(v_{1},\ldots,v_{j}',\ldots, v_{p})$$
