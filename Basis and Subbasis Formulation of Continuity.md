> [!prop]
> Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s, and suppose the [[Topology]] of $Y$ is given by a [[Basis of a Topology]] [[notation for basis]]. A [[Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is [[Continuous]] if for each [[Basis of a Topology]] element $B$ of [[notation for basis]], the [[Set]] $U = f$[[notation for inverse]]$(B)$ is an [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$.

> [!proof]
> Let $V$ be an [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $Y$. Then, $V$ can be written as a [[Union]] of [[Basis of a Topology]] elements $V = \bigcup B_\alpha$. Then
> $$f^{-1}(V) = \bigcup f^{-1}(B_\alpha)$$
> as [[Union Under Preimage]]. As the [[Preimage]] of each basis element is [[Open Set]], the [[Union]] of [[Open Set]] sets is [[Open Set]]. 
> [[therefore]] $f$ is [[Continuous]].

> [!prop]
> Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s, and suppose the [[Topology]] of $Y$ is given by a [[Subbasis]] $\mathcal{S}$. A [[Function]] $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is [[Continuous]] if for each [[Subbasis]] element $S$ of $\mathcal{S}$, the [[Preimage]] $U = f$[[notation for inverse]]$(S)$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$.

> [!proof]
> Let $B$ be a [[Basis of a Topology]] element of the [[Basis of a Topology]] generated by the [[Subbasis]] $\mathcal{S}$ of $Y$. Then, $B$ can be written as a finite [[Intersection]] of [[Subbasis]] elements: $B = \bigcap S_\alpha$. Then
> $f^{-1}(B) = \bigcap f^{-1}(S_\alpha)$
> as [[Intersection Under Preimage]]. As the [[Preimage]] of any [[Basis of a Topology]] element is [[Open Set]], $f$ is [[Continuous]] by the previous lemma.
