>[!thm]
>Every [[Continuous]] $1$-[[Periodic]] [[Function]] $f\in\mathcal{C_{1}}(\mathbb{R};\mathbb{C})$ can be uniformly approximated by [[Trigonometric Polynomial]]s, ie for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists a [[Trigonometric Polynomial]] $p\in \mathcal{T}$, depending on both $f$ and $\epsilon$ such that the [[Supremum Norm]] $$||p-f||_{\infty}<\epsilon$$

>[!note]
>We use uniformly approximated to mean that the $p$'s [[Uniform Convergence]] to $f$

>[!note]
>These are constructed explicitly by [[Fej√©r's Theorem]].
