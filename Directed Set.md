>A *directed [[Set]]* is a [[Partially Ordered Set]] $I$ with the property that if $x,y\in I$, there is a $z\in I$ such that $x,y≤k$.

>[!note]
If $I$ is directed, and $i_{1},\ldots,i_{n}\in I$, then there is an $i\in I$ with $i_{1},\ldots i_{n}≤i$ ([[Principle of Mathematical Induction]]).

Examples:
1. $\mathbb{N}$
2. $\mathbb{Z}$
3. $X$ is any set, [[notation for power set]]$(X)$ is a directed set.
