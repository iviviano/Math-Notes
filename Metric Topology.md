```ad-def
If $d$ is a [[Metric]] on the [[Set]] $X$, then the collection of all $\epsilon$-[[Set Theory/Ball|Ball]]s [[Notation/ball|ball]], for $x\in X$ and $\epsilon>0$ is a [[Topology/Basis|Basis]] for a [[Topology]] on $X$, called the *metric topology* induced by $d$.
```

```ad-def
A set $U$ is [[Open Set]] in the [[Metric Topology]] induced by $d$ [[iff]] for each $y\in U$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $B_d(y, \delta)\subseteq U$.
