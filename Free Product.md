>Let $G,H$ be two [[Group]]s. Their *free product* is defined by $$G*H=\{g_{1}h_{1}g_{2}h_{2}\cdots g_{k}h_{k}:g_{i}\in G,h_{i}\in H\}$$

>[!def]
Let $\langle S_{G}|R_{G}\rangle$ and $\langle S_{H}|R_H\rangle$ be [[Presentation]]s of $G,H$. The *free product* has [[Presentation]] $$G*H=\langle S_{G}\sqcup S_{H}|R_{G}\cup R_{H}\rangle$$
