> A [[Topological Space]] $X$ is called a *Hausdorff space* if it possesses the [[Hausdorff Axiom]].

Hausdorff Spaces have many nice properties and are the [[Topology]]cally interesting spaces:
1. [[Sequences Converge Uniquely in Hausdorff Spaces Theorem]] (a [[Sequence]] that [[Converges (Sequence)|Converges (Sequence)]]s has a [[Limit of a Sequence]])
2. [[Limit Points in T1 Spaces Theorem]]
3. 

Example of non-Hausdorff Space:
The line with two origins: $X=(\mathbb{R}-\{0\})\cup\{x,y\}$. $T=$ all [[Union]]s of [[Open Set]] [[Subset]]s of $\mathbb{R}$ that don't contain $0$ along with sets of the form $(-a,0)\cup\{x\}\cup(0,a)$ and $(-b,0)\cup\{y\}\cup(0,b)$.
