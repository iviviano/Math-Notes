```ad-def
A [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]] $X$ is called a *Hausdorff space* if it possesses the [[Hausdorff Axiom]].
```

Hausdorff Spaces have many nice properties and are the [[Topology]]cally interesting spaces:
1. [[Sequences Converge Uniquely in Hausdorff Spaces Theorem]] (a [[Sequence]] that [[Converges|Converges]] has a [[Limit of a Sequence]])
2. [[Limit Points in T1 Spaces Theorem]]
3.
