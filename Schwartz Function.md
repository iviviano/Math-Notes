A [[Complex-Valued Function]] $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is called a *Schwartz [[Function]]* if for all $m,n\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$, one has $$C_{m,n}:=\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}\left|x^{m}f^{(n)}(x)\right|<\infty$$

>On [[set_7(7).pdf]], we showed that this is a [[Vector Space]] closed under products. Thus, it is an [[Algebra]].

>[!note]
>If $f\in\mathcal{S}$, then the [[Fourier Transform]] $\widehat f\in\mathcal{S}$. This combined with the fact that the [[Fourier Transform]] $\mathcal{F}$ is [[Linear]] and [[Bijective]], we see that $\mathcal{F}$ is a [[Isomorphism]] of $\mathcal{S}$ to itself.
