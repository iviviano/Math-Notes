>A $p$-[[P-Form]] on an [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ is said to be *smooth* if each coefficient [[Function]] $a_{I}$ in its expansion $$\sum_{I}a_{I}dx_{I}$$is [[Smooth]]. Note: $dx_{I}=dx_{i_{1}}\land\cdots\land dx_{i_{p}}$

>A $p$-[[P-Form]] $\omega$ on a [[Manifold]] $X$ is said to be *smooth* if for every [[Local]] [[Parameterization]] $h:U \rightarrow X$, $h^{*}\omega$ is a smooth form on the [[Open Set]] [[Set]] $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^{k}$.
