Suppose $S\subseteq[a,b]$ is a [[Set]] which can be expressed as a finite [[Union]] of [[Closed Set]] intervals $$S=\bigcup_{1≤j≤n}[t_{j},t_{j+1}]$$which are pairwise [[Disjoint]] except possible for endpoints. Define the length of $S$ by $$|S|=\sum_{j=1}^{n}t_{j+1}-t_{j}$$Then, for every $f\in\mathcal{R}([a,b];\mathbb{C})$, we have $$\left|\int_{S}f(t)dt\right|≤||f||_{S;\infty}\cdot|S|$$where $||f||_{S;\infty}$ is the [[Supremum Norm]]

>[!note]
>M for "maximum" of $f$ and L for the length of the interval of integration.
