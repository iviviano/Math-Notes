mathLink: unions of overlapping connected sets are connected

>[!prop]
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Then 
>1. If $\{E_{i}:i\in I\}$ is a collection of [[Connected]] [[Set]]s in $X$ such that for all $i,j\in I:E_{i}\cap E_{j}â‰ \emptyset$, $\bigcup E_{i}$ is [[Connected]]
>2. If $\{E_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Connected]] [[Subset]]s of $X$ such that for all $n:E_{n}\cap E_{n+1}\ne \emptyset$, then $\bigcup E_{n}$ is [[Connected]]

>[!prop] Corollary
>The [[Union]] of two [[Connected]] [[Subset]]s of a [[Metric Space]] which [[Intersects]] is [[Connected]]
