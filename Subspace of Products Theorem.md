> [!thm]
> Let $A_\alpha$ be a [[Subspace]] of $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in J$. Then, $\prod A_\alpha$ is a [[Subspace]] of $\prod X_\alpha$ if both products are given the [[Box Topology]], or if both products are given the [[Product Topology]].

> [!proof]
> Product Topology:
> Let $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ be a [[Basis of a Topology]] for $X_\alpha$. Then, let $\mathcal{B}$ be the [[Basis of a Topology]] obtained from $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ using the [[Basis for the Product Topology Theorem]]. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the [[Basis of a Topology]] for the [[Subspace Topology]] on $\prod X_\alpha$ obtained from the [[Subspace Basis Lemma]]. Let $\mathcal{C}'_\alpha$ be the [[Basis of a Topology]] obtained for $A_\alpha$ via the [[Subspace Basis Lemma]]. Let $\mathcal{C}'$ be the [[Basis of a Topology]] obtained via the [[Basis for the Product Topology Theorem]] on $\prod A_\alpha$.

> Let $\mathbf{x}\in \prod A_\alpha$ be given. Let $C\in\mathcal{C}$ with $\mathbf{x}\in C$. Then, pick $B\in B$ such that $C = \prod A_\alpha$ [[intersection]] $B = \prod(A_\alpha\cap B_\alpha)$. But, $A_\alpha\cap B_\alpha\in C'_\alpha$, so $C' = C\in\mathcal{C}'_\alpha$. Therefore,
> $\mathbf{x}\in C'\subseteq C$
> As $B_\alpha\ne X_\alpha$ for only finitely many $\alpha$, $C_\alpha = B_\alpha\cap A_\alpha\ne A_\alpha\cap X_\alpha$ for only finitely many $\alpha$. [[therefore]] $C'\in\mathcal{C}'$, so the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}'$ is [[Finer]] than the [[Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{B}$ by the [[Finer Bases Lemma]]

> Let $C'\in\mathcal{C}'$ with $\mathbf{x}\in C'$. Then, for each $\alpha$, pick $B_\alpha\in\mathcal{B_\alpha}$ such that if $C'_\alpha = A_\alpha$, $B_\alpha = $X_\alpha$ and $C_\alpha'=A_\alpha\cap B_\alpha$ otherwise. Taking $C = \prod(A_\alpha\cap B_\alpha) = \prod A_\alpha \cap B$ where $B = \prod B_\alpha$,
