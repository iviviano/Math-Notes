>[!def]
>Let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be [[Open Set]]. A [[Function]] $f:U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is *smooth* if it has [[Continuous]] [[Partial Derivative]]s of all [[Order]]s.

>[!def] Extension to Arbitrary Sets
>Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$. A [[Function]] $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is *smooth* if for every point $x\in X$, there is a [[Neighborhood]] $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ of $x$ such that $F:U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is smooth and $f=F$ for $x\in U\cap X$ (a relatively [[Open Set]] in the [[Subspace]] $X$).
