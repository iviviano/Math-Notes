> [!def]
> If $d$ is a [[Metric]] on the [[Set]] $X$, then the collection of all $\epsilon$-[[Ball]]s [[ball]], for $x\in X$ and $\epsilon>0$ is a [[Basis]] for a [[Topology]] on $X$, called the *metric topology* induced by $d$.

> [!def]
> A set $U$ is [[Open Set]] in the [[Metric Topology]] induced by $d$ [[iff]] for each $y\in U$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $B_d(y, \delta)\subseteq U$.
