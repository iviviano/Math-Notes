mathLink: uniqueness of inverses in semigroups theorem
---
>[!thm]
>Let $(G,\circ)$ be a [[Semigroup]] with an [[Identity of a Groupoid]] element $1$. If $g\in G$ has an [[Inverse of a Groupoid Element]], then it has precisely one. 

>[!proof]
>Let $h,h_{1}\in G$ be [[Inverse of a Groupoid Element]]s of $g$. Then, $$h=h\circ 1=h\circ(g\circ h')=(h\circ g)\circ h'=1\circ h'=h'$$

>[!not]
>The [[Inverse]] is often notated $g^{-1}$ in a [[Semigroup]].
