>Given $n\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ and real numbers $a_{0},\ldots,a_{n}$ satisfying $$a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}>0$$a *finite continued fraction* is a rational expression $$[a_{0};a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}]:=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\cdots\frac{1}{a_{n-1}+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}}}$$where $a_{0},\cdots a_{n}$ are the [[Elements of a Continued Fraction]]s.
