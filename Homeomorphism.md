```ad-def
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]s; let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a [[Bijective]] [[Function]]. If both the function $f$ and the [[Set Theory/Inverse|Inverse]] [[Function]] $f$[[Notation/inverse|inverse]]$:Y\rightarrow X$ are [[Continuous]], then $f$ is called a *homeomorphism*.

Another way to define it: a [[Bijective]] correspondence $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that $f(U)$ is [[Open Set]] [[iff]] $U$ is [[Open Set]].
