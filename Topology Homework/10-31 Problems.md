Show that $f$ is [[Closed Set]] map. Let $K\subseteq X$ be [[Closed Set]]. Then $K$ is [[Compactness]] by the [[Characterizations of Compactness]]. So, $f(K)\subseteq Z$ is [[Compactness]] by the [[Characterizations of Compactness]]. As $f(K)$ is [[Compactness]], it is [[Closed Set]] by the [[Characterizations of Compactness]]. As $f$ is a [[Closed Set]] map, $f^{-1}$ is [[Continuous]] by the [[Characterizations of Continuity Theorem]]. As $f$ is [[Continuous]] and $f^{-1}$ is [[Continuous]], $f$ is a [[Homeomorphism]].

Let $X_{1},X_{2}$ be [[Compactness]]. Let $X=X_{1}\times X_{2}$. Let $$\mathcal{S}=\{\pi_{1}^{-1}(U):U \text{ is open in }X_{1}\}\cup\{\pi_{2}^{-1}(U):U \text{ is open in }X_{2}\}$$Then, $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[Subbasis]] for $X$. Clearly, $\mathcal{S}\ni \pi_{1}^{-1}(X_{1})=X_{1}\times X_{2}$, so $\mathcal{S}$ [[Cover]]s $X$. To show the Hausdorff property, let $(x_{1},x_{2}),(y_{1},y_{2})\in X$. As $X_{1}$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]], pick [[Disjoint]] [[Neighborhood]]s $U_{1}$ of $x_{1}$ and $V_{1}$ of $y_{1}$. Then, $\pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{1})$ is [[Disjoint]] from $\pi_{1}^{-1}(V_{1})$, since $(x,y)\in \pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{1})$ implies $x\in U_{1}$, so $x\notin V_{1}$ and $(x,y)\notin \pi_{1}^{-1}(V_{1})$. Additionally, $(x_{1},y_{1})\in \pi^{-1}_{1}(U_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})\in \pi^{-1}_{1}(V_{1})$. Therefore, $\mathcal{S}$ satisfies the Hausdorff property and is a [[Subbasis]] for a [[Hausdorff Space]] on $X$.

Show that $\mathcal{S}$ generates the [[Product Topology]] on $X$:
>
Let $U$ be a [[Basis of a Topology]] element of the [[Product Topology]] on $X$. Then, $U=U_{1}\times U_{2}$ where $U_{1}$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_{2}$. Then, $U=\pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{1})\cap \pi_{2}^{-1}(U_{2})$, so $U$ is an element of the [[Basis of a Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{S}$. 
>
As [[Projection]] maps are [[Continuous]], it is clear that all finite [[Intersection]]s of [[Union]]s of [[Set]]s in $\mathcal{S}$ are [[Open Set]] in the [[Product Topology]] on $X$.
>
So, $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[Subbasis]] for the [[Product Topology]] on $X$.

Let $\mathcal{U}\subseteq \mathcal{S}$ be a [[Cover]] of $X$. Then, $$\mathcal{S}_{1}=\{\pi_{1}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}\}\text{ and }\mathcal{S}_{2}=\{\pi_{2}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}\}$$are [[open Cover]]s of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, respectively. As $X_{1},X_{2}$ are [[Compactness]], $\mathcal{S}_1,\mathcal{S}_2$ omit finite [[Subcover]]s $\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2$. Let $$\mathcal{U}'=\{\pi_{1}^{-1}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}_{1}\}\cup\{\pi_{2}^{-1}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}_2\}$$Clearly, $\mathcal{U}'$ is finite. As $\pi^{-1}(\pi(U))=U$, $\mathcal{U}'$ is a [[Subcover]] of $\mathcal{U}$. [[therefore]] by [[Alexander's Theorem]], $X$ is [[Compactness]].
