Let $xâ‰ y\in \mathbb{R}$ be given. Then, $\left(-\infty, \frac{x+y}{2}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{x+y}{2},\infty\right)$ are [[Disjoint]] [[Neighborhood]]s of $x$ and $y$. Therefore, $X$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]]. $\mathbb{Q}$ is [[Open Set]], so $\mathbb{I}$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$. Suppose there were [[Open Set]] [[Set]]s $U,V$ such that $0\in U$ and $\mathbb{I}\subseteq V$. Any [[Open Set]] set containing $\mathbb{I}$ must be an [[Intersection]] of finitely many [[Open Set]] intervals. Since $\mathbb{I}$ has elements arbitrarily close to $0$ and $V$ excludes only finitely many rationals, $V$ must contain rationals arbitrarily close to $0$. Since any [[Neighborhood]] of $0$ also contains infinitely many rationals arbitrary close to $0$, $U$ and $V$ cannot be [[Disjoint]].

Let $x\in X$ and $F\subseteq X$ be given. Suppose without loss of generality that $x\in F_{1}$. Pick [[Disjoint]] [[Open Set]] [[Set]]s $U_{1},V_{1}$ in $F_{1}$ such that $x\in U_{1}\subseteq F_{1}$ and $F\cap F_{1}\subseteq U_{2}$. Let
