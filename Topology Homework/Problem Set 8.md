Show that $f$ is [[Closed Set]] map. Let $K\subseteq X$ be [[Closed Set]]. Then $K$ is [[Compactness]] by the [[Characterizations of Compactness]]. So, $f(K)\subseteq Z$ is [[Compactness]] by the [[Characterizations of Compactness]]. As $f(K)$ is [[Compactness]], it is [[Closed Set]] by the [[Characterizations of Compactness]]. As $f$ is a [[Closed Set]] map, $f^{-1}$ is [[Continuous]] by the [[Characterizations of Continuity Theorem]]. As $f$ is [[Continuous]] and $f^{-1}$ is [[Continuous]], $f$ is a [[Homeomorphism]].

Let $X_{1},X_{2}$ be [[Compactness]]. Let $X=X_{1}\times X_{2}$. Let $$\mathcal{S}=\{\pi_{1}^{-1}(U):U \text{ is open in }X_{1}\}\cup\{\pi_{2}^{-1}(U):U \text{ is open in }X_{2}\}$$Then, $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[Subbasis]] for $X$. Clearly, $\mathcal{S}\ni \pi_{1}^{-1}(X_{1})=X_{1}\times X_{2}$, so $\mathcal{S}$ [[Cover]]s $X$. To show the Hausdorff property, let $(x_{1},x_{2}),(y_{1},y_{2})\in X$. As $X_{1}$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]], pick [[Disjoint]] [[Neighborhood]]s $U_{1}$ of $x_{1}$ and $V_{1}$ of $y_{1}$. Then, $\pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{1})$ is [[Disjoint]] from $\pi_{1}^{-1}(V_{1})$, since $(x,y)\in \pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{1})$ implies $x\in U_{1}$, so $x\notin V_{1}$ and $(x,y)\notin \pi_{1}^{-1}(V_{1})$. Additionally, $(x_{1},y_{1})\in \pi^{-1}_{1}(U_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})\in \pi^{-1}_{1}(V_{1})$. Therefore, $\mathcal{S}$ satisfies the Hausdorff property and is a [[Subbasis]] for a [[Hausdorff Space]] on $X$.
>
Show that $\mathcal{S}$ generates the [[Product Topology]] on $X$:
>
Let $U$ be a [[Basis of a Topology]] element of the [[Product Topology]] on $X$. Then, $U=U_{1}\times U_{2}$ where $U_{1}$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_{2}$. Then, $U=\pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{1})\cap \pi_{2}^{-1}(U_{2})$, so $U$ is an element of the [[Basis of a Topology]] generated by $\mathcal{S}$. 
>
As [[Projection]] maps are [[Continuous]], it is clear that all finite [[Intersection]]s of [[Union]]s of [[Set]]s in $\mathcal{S}$ are [[Open Set]] in the [[Product Topology]] on $X$.
>
So, $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[Subbasis]] for the [[Product Topology]] on $X$.
>
Let $\mathcal{U}\subseteq \mathcal{S}$ be a [[Cover]] of $X$. Then, $$\mathcal{S}_{1}=\{\pi_{1}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}\}\text{ and }\mathcal{S}_{2}=\{\pi_{2}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}\}$$are [[open Cover]]s of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, respectively. As $X_{1},X_{2}$ are [[Compactness]], $\mathcal{S}_1,\mathcal{S}_2$ omit finite [[Subcover]]s $\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2$. Let $$\mathcal{U}'=\{\pi_{1}^{-1}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}_{1}\}\cup\{\pi_{2}^{-1}(U):U\in \mathcal{U}_2\}$$Clearly, $\mathcal{U}'$ is finite. As $\pi^{-1}(\pi(U))=U$, $\mathcal{U}'$ is a [[Subcover]] of $\mathcal{U}$. [[therefore]] by [[Alexander's Theorem]], $X$ is [[Compactness]].

Claim: the [[Connected]] [[Subset]]s of $\{0,1\}$ under the [[Discrete Topology]] are $\emptyset ,\{0\},\{1\}$. Obviously, these three sets are [[Connected]]. For each, the only subsets are the empty set and the set itself, so these are the only sets that are clopen in the [[Subspace]]s. $\{0\}$ is [[Open Set]] in $\{0,1\}$ as all sets are [[Open Set]] in the [[Discrete Topology]]. $\{0\}$ is [[Closed Set]] in $\{0,1\}$ as all [[Set]]s are [[Closed Set]] in the [[Discrete Topology]]. As $\{0\}$ is clopen, $\{0,1\}$ is not [[Connected]].
>
Suppose $X$ is [[Connected]]. Let $f:X \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be [[Continuous]]. As $f$ is [[Continuous]] and $X$ is [[Connected]], $f(X)$ is [[Connected]] by the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]]. This implies that $f(X)\ne\{0,1\}$. Only if $X=\emptyset$ can $f(X)=\emptyset$. So, $f$ is constant by the claim.
>
Suppose that every continuous function from $X$ into $\{0,1\}$ is constant, and assume $X$ is not connected. So, $X=A\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are both [[Open Set]] or both [[Closed Set]], [[Disjoint]], and nonempty. Let $f:X \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be given by the [[Rule of Assignment]] $$f(x)=\begin{cases}0\text{ if }x\in A \\
1\text{ if }x\in B\end{cases}$$Then, $f$ is [[Continuous]]: first assume $A, B$ both [[Open Set]]:
>- $f^{-1}(\emptyset )=\emptyset$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$
>- $f^{-1}(\{0\})=A$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$
>- $f^{-1}(\{1\})=B$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$
>- $f^{-1}(\{0,1\})=X$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$
>
so the [[Preimage]] of every [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$ is [[Open Set]] under $f$, so $f$ is [[Continuous]]. Now, if $A, B$ are both [[Closed Set]]:
>- $f^{-1}(\emptyset )=\emptyset$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$
>- $f^{-1}(\{0\})=A$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$
>- $f^{-1}(\{1\})=B$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$
>- $f^{-1}(\{0,1\})=X$ is [[Closed Set]] in $X$
>
so the [[Preimage]] of every [[Closed Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$ is [[Open Set]] under $f$, so $f$ is [[Continuous]] by the [[Characterizations of Continuity Theorem]]. As $f$ is not constant since $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, this contradicts the assumption that $X$ is not [[Connected]].

Let $X=\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Let $A=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^{2}:x^{2}+y^{2}=1,x\ge0\}$. $A$ is the [[Image]] of a [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ mapping $x\mapsto(\sqrt{1-x^{2}},x)$. As $\mathbb{R}$ is [[Connected]], $A=f(\mathbb{R})$ is [[Connected]] by the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]]. Let $B=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^{2}:x=0\}$. $B$ is the [[Image]] of the [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ mapping $x\mapsto(0,x)$. As $\mathbb{R}$ is [[Connected]], $B=f(\mathbb{R})$ is [[Connected]] by the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]]. Then, $A,B$ are [[Connected]]. However, $A\cap B=\{(0,1),(0,-1)\}$. As $\{(0,1)\}\cup\{(0,-1)\}=A\cap B$, $A\cap B$ is not connected.
