>Let $X,Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s. Suppose $\text{dim }X<\text{dim }Y$. If the [[Derivative]] of $f$ at $x$: $df_{x}:T_{x}(X)\rightarrow T_{f(x)}(Y)$ is [[Injective]], then $f$ is said to be an *immersion* at $x$. $f$ is simply said to be an *immersion* if it is an immersion at $x$ for all $x\in X$.
