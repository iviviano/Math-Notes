>If $\phi:X \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is a [[Smooth]] [[Function]], the [[Derivative]] $d \phi_{x}:T_{x}(X)\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is a [[Linear]] map at each point $x$. Thus the assignment $x \mapsto d \phi_{x}$ defines a $1$-[[P-Form]] $d \phi$ on $X$, called the *differential* of $\phi$.

>[!note]
>$d \phi_{x}$ is [[Linear]] since the [[Derivative]] is the best [[Linear]] approximation at $x$. As $\phi$ maps into $\mathbb{R}$, the field of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $d \phi_{x}$ is a $1$-tensor. Since all $1$-[[P-Tensor]]s are [[Alternating Tensor]], $d \phi$ is a $1$-[[P-Form]].
