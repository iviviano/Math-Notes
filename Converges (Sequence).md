> [!def]
> Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]; let $\{x_n\}$ be a [[Sequence]] in $X$. We say $x_n$ *converges* to $x$ if for each [[Neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$:
> $$\exists N\in\mathbb{N}: x_n\in U\text{ for all } n \ge N$$

>[!note]
In $\mathbb{R}$, a sequence cannot converge to more than one point, but in arbitrary spaces, it can!

>[!note]
>In the [[Discrete Metric]] space, a [[Sequence]] [[Converges (Sequence)]]s [[iff]] $\exists N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall m,nâ‰¥N$, $x_{m}=x_{n}$.

Notation: $x_n$ [[notation for converges]] $x$
