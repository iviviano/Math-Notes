Diffusion (Heat) Equation: $$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= D\cdot\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}\quad(*)
$$where $D>0$ is the diffusion coefficient.

We typically start with an initial concentration profile: $$u_{0}(x)=u(x,t=0)$$
Assume $u_{0}(x)\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$. This implies that $u(x,t)\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ in $x$ and $t$.

Take [[Fourier Transform]] with respect to $x$ for fixed $t>0$:
$$\begin{align*}
g(k,t)&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(x,t)~e^{-2\pi ixk}\ dx\\
\end{align*}$$
The [[Fourier Differentiation Mantra]] gives: RHS of ($*$) becomes $$
D(2\pi ik)^{2}g(k,t)=-D(2\pi )^{2}k^{2}g(k,t)
$$
The LHS becomes: $$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F} \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right)&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,t)~e^{-2\pi ikx}\ dx\\
&= \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\underbrace{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(x,t)~e^{-2\pi ikx}\ dx}_{=g(k,t)}\\
&= \frac{\partial g}{\partial t}(k,t)
\end{align*}$$
We can justify switching the derivative and the integral since $u$ is a Schwartz function.

We have transformed $(*)$ into the differential equation: $$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}(k,t)=-4\pi^{2}D\cdot k^{2}g(k,t)\quad(**)
$$
Think about $(**)$ for each fixed $k\in \mathbb{R}$. This is the decay equation: $$
\frac{df}{dt}=\alpha(t)f
$$, which has solution: $$
f(t)= f(0)\exp\left(\int_{0}^{t} \alpha(s)\ ds\right)
$$
So, $(**)$ has solution: $$
g(k,t)= g(k,t=0)\cdot e^{-4\pi^{2}Dk^{2}t}
$$
We want the solution to $(*)$ in terms of $x$ and $t$. Since $g(k,t=0)$ is $\widehat{u_{0}}(k)\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ and $e^{-4\pi^{2}Dk^{2}t}$ is a [[Gaussian]], we have the product of [[Schwartz Function]] [[Function]]s $g\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R};\mathbb{C})$. Applying problem 3 of [[Harmonic Analysis Homework/Set 10/Notes|Notes]], $u(x,t)=$ convolution of the inverse transforms. From [[Gaussian Invariance]], $$\begin{align*}
u(x,t)&= \frac{2}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u_{0}(x')e^{-\pi^{2} \frac{(x-x')^{2}}{4Dt}}dx'
\end{align*}
$$
As $t \rightarrow \infty$,
$$|u(x,t)|\le \frac{1}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\|u_{0}\|_{\mathcal{L}^{1}}$$
As $t \rightarrow 0^{+}$, we have a convolution with an approximate delta function, so [[Approximate Identities on R Theorem]] so $$u(x,t)\rightarrow u_{0}(x)$$
If $u_{0}$ were an arbitrary integrable function ([[L1 Function]]), we would still get the same formula with appropriate convergence (can verify that $u$ satisfies $(*)$).





What about the [[Wave Equation]]? $$
\frac{\partial ^{2}y}{\partial t^{2}}=c^{2} \frac{\partial ^{2}y}{\partial x^{2}}
$$
[[Fourier Transform]] of LHS: $$
\frac{\partial ^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}g(x,t)
$$
RHS: $$-c^{2}4\pi^{2}k^{2}g$$
This is the Oscillator Equation. The general solution is given in [[set_2(1).pdf]]: $$g(k,t)=A\sin(2\pi ckt+\phi_{0})$$But, this is not invertible since $\sin$ is not $\mathcal{L}^{1}$.
