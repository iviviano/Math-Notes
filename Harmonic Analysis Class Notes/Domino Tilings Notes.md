Domino Tilings of a Checkerboard (alternating black and white squares)
- Four types of dominos based on orientation and placement of squares covered
Easy to construct a tiling of a $2n\times 2n$ board. Question: how many?
- start with $2n\times2$ board. We get the Fibonacci sequence with $D_{2}=2$ and $D_{1}=1$.
- Theorem by Kasteleyn: number of tilings given closed form product with $D(2n,2n)\sim\exp(4Gn^{2}/\pi)$.
When is the board tileable?
- need equal number of black and white squares, since each domino covers one of each
- but that is not sufficient
- unique brickwork tiling
Aztec Diamond - number of tilings a power of 2
Random tilings of the Aztec Diamond:
- disordered center
- frozen corners have the brickwork pattern
- separated by the arctic circle
	- fluctuations of which have a limiting distribution (like central limit theorem, other tiling models also converge to the same distribution!)
		- this same limit theorem applies in random matrix theory
