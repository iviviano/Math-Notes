Pythagoras' Tuning Problem
1. Stacking fifths on top of each other, creating the tones with frequencies $$\nu_{1} \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{n}, n\in \mathbb{N}$$creates an infinite sequence of tones, in particular one ***never*** reaches (an octave of) the fundamental frequency $$
nu_{1}\cdot2^{k},\text{ for some }k\in \mathbb{N}
$$
2. After stacking $n=12$ fifths, one comes VERY close to (an octave) of the fundamental frequency, however with a noticeable discrepancy 

cent scale: $$d_{c}(\nu_{1},\nu_{2})= [\log_{2} \nu_{2}-\log_{2} \nu_{1}]\cdot1200$$
With our model, adding fifths becomes: $$\log_{2} \left(\nu\cdot \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}\right)(\mod1)=\log_{2}\nu+n\log_{2}3(\mod1)$$
We can think of addition $\mod1$ as rotations on a circle of radius $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ (circumference 1). This may also be stated as adding angle in units of $2\pi$.
