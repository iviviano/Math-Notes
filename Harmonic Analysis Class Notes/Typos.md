Here are typos I noticed while reading along.

Page 15 "a the" between 2.23 and 2.24
Page 35 between 3.25 and 3.26 "convergence" should be "converge"
Page 36 (3.28) negative sign in fraction should be in front ($\frac{-1}{n}$ vs $- \frac{1}{n}$)
Page 67 $x_k$ in (4.107) should be $v_{k}$
Page 88 the $\mathbb{S}$ in (5.43) should be $S$
Page 93 (5.68) the opening $\{$ should be big
Page 98 (5.97) the $1$ should be a $t$ in the subscript of the $\sup$
Page 100 paragraph after (5.104) (of size $\delta>0$) should be $\delta_t$
Page 100 between (5.105) and (5.106) sup should be sub
Page 148 (7.79) is not true if $n=0$

Consistency with $$X, \text{ as }n \rightarrow \infty$$and $$X \text{ as }n \rightarrow \infty$$
