```ad-def
Let $J$ be an index [[Set]]. Given a set $X$, we define a *$J$-tuple* of elements of $X$ to be a [[Function]] $\mathbf{x} :J\rightarrow X$. 
```

```ad-not
If $\alpha\in J$, we often denote the value of $\mathbf{x}$ at $\alpha$ be $x_\alpha$ rather than $\mathbf{x}$; we call it the $\alpha$th *coordinate* of $\mathbf{x}$. And we often denote the function $\mathbf{x}$ by the symbol 
$$(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}$$
The set of all $J$-tuples of $X$ is denoted $X^J$. 
```
