mathLink: finite sets in Hausdorff spaces are closed
---
> [!thm]
> Every finite point [[Set]] in a [[Hausdorff Space]] $X$ is [[Closed Set]].

> [!proof]
> It suffices to show that every one-point [[Set]] in $X$ is [[Closed Set]] and [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]] implies the rest. Let $x_0, x\in X$. Then, $x_0, x$ have neighborhoods $U_0, U$ that are [[Disjoint]] by the [[Hausdorff Axiom]]. Since $U$ does not [[Intersects]] $\{x_0\}$ [[subset]] $U_0$, $x$ is not in the [[Closure]] of $\{x_0\}$ by the [[Open Sets Intersecting the Closure Intersect the Set Theorem]]. [[therefore]] the [[Closure]] of $\{x_0\}$ is $\{x_0\}$, so $\{x_0\}$ is [[Closed Set]].
