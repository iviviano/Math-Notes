Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. $X$ is said to be *completely regular* if for any [[Closed Set]] [[Set]] $F\subseteq X$, and any point $x\in X-F$, there is a [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=1$ and $f(y)=0$ for all $y\in F$.

1. [[Urysohn's Lemma]] implies that [[Metric Space]]s are completely regular
2. [[Discrete Topology]] is completely regular
