>[!thm]
If $X$ is a [[Topological Space]], then the following are equivalent.
>1. $X$ is [[Completely Regular]].
>2. The [[Topology]] on $X$ is the [[Weak Topology]] defined by the [[Function]]s in [[Vector Space of Continuous Functions]]$(X)$
>3. The [[Topology]] on $X$ is the [[Weak Topology]] defined by the [[Function]]s in [[Vector Space of Continuous Bounded Functions]]$(X)$
>4. A [[Net]] in $X$ [[Converges (net)]]s to $x$ [[iff]] $f(x_{i})\rightarrow f(x)$ for each [[Continuous]] [[Function]] $f:X \rightarrow[0,1]$
