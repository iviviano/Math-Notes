mathLink: sequences converge uniquely in Hausdorff spaces
---
```ad-thm
If $X$ is a [[Hausdorff Space]], then a [[Sequaence]] of points of $X$ [[Topology/Converges|Converges]] to at most one point of $X$.
```

```ad-proof
Suppose a sequence converges to more than one point in a [[Hausdorff Space]]. Then, we can pick [[Disjoint]] [[Neighborhood]]s about those two points: $U_1, U_2$. Then pick $N$ such that all elements of the sequence past $N$ are in both $U_1$ and $U_2$. But this implies the sequence is empty as $U_1$ and $U_2$ are disjoint.
