>Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] that is [[Local Pathwise Connectedness]]. Then, an [[Open Set]] [[Subset]] of $X$ is [[Connected]] [[iff]] it is [[Pathwise Connectedness]].

Suppose $U\subseteq X$ is [[Open Set]] and [[Pathwise Connectedness]]. Then, it is [[Pathwise Connectedness]] by the [[Unions of Overlapping Pathwise Connected Sets are Pathwise Connected]] proposition.
Suppose $U\subseteq X$ is [[Open Set]] and [[Connected]].
