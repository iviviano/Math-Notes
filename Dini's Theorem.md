>[!prop]
If $X$ is [[Compactness]], $f_{n}$ is an increasing [[Sequence]] in [[Vector Space of Continuous Functions]]$(X)$, and $f\in C(X)$ such that $f_{n}(x)\rightarrow f(x)$ for all $x\in X$, then $f_{n}$ does [[Uniform Convergence]] to $f$ on $X$.

As $f_{n}$ is increasing, $f_{n}$ is [[Bounded Function into R]] below for all $n$. Additionally, $f_{n}$ is [[Bounded Function into R]] above by $f$.
