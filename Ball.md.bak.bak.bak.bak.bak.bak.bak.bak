> [!def]
> Given a metrix $d$ on $X$ and $\epsilon > 0$, the set
> $B_d(x, \epsilon) = \{y\in X|d(x, y)< \epsilon\}$
> of all points whose distance from $x$ is less than $\epsilon$ is called the $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-*ball centered at $x$*.

> [!not]
> A ball may be notated $B_d(x, \epsilon)$, $B(x, \epsilon)$, or $B_\epsilon(x)$.
