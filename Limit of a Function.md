Let $f:X \mapsto Y$ is a [[Function]] and $X,Y$ are [[Topological Space]]s with $Y$ satisfying the [[Hausdorff Axiom]]. Let $A\subseteq X,x\in X,L\in Y$ with $x$ a [[Limit Point]] of $A$. Then, the *limit as $f$ approaches $x$* is said to be $L$ if for all [[Neighborhood]]s $V$ of $L$ in $Y$, there is a [[Neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $f(U\cap A-\{x\})\subseteq V$.
