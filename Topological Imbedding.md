```ad-def
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topology/Topological Space|Topological Space]]s; let $f : $X$ \rightarrow Y$ be an [[Injective]] [[Continuous]] [[Function]]. Let $Z$ be the [[Image]] set $f(X)$, considered as a [[Subspace]] of $Y$; Then the function $f':X\rightarrow Z$ obtained restricting the [[Range]] of $f$ to $Z$ is [[Bijective]]. Id $f'$ happens to be a [[Homeomorphism]] with $Z$, we say that $f$ is a *topological imbedding* of $X$ in $Y$.
