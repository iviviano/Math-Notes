> Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s. The *product topology* on $X$[[notation for cartesian product]]$Y$ is the [[Topology]] having as [[Basis]] the collection [[notation for basis]] of all sets of the form $U$[[notation for cartesian product]] $V$ where $U$ is [[Open Set]] in $X$ and $V$ is [[Open Set]] in $Y$.

Consider the more general [[Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]]s:
$$X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n \text{  and  } X_1\times X_2\times\cdots$$
where each $X_i$ is a [[Topological Space|Topological Space]].

> Then, the *box topology* may be on the product space can be formed using the as [[Basis]] all sets of the form: $U_1\times\cdots\times U_n$ in the first case, and of $U_1\times U_2\cdots$ in the second case, where $U_i$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_i$ for each $i$. 

> [!def]
> We define the *product topology* using the [[Subbasis for the Product Topology Theorem]]. We take as a [[Subbasis]] all sets of the form $\pi_i$[[notation for inverse]]$(U_i)$ where $U_i$ is [[Open Set]] in $X_i$. 

Note: the [[Box Topology]] is the as the product topology for finite [[Cartesian Product|Cartesian Product]]s (result of the [[Comparison of the Box and Product Topologies Theorem]]).
