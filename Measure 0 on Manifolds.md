>The concept of [[Lebesgue Measure]] zero can be extended to [[Manifold]]s with [[Parameterization]]s. A [[Subset]] $C\subseteq Y$ has *measure zero* if for every [[Local]] [[Parameterization]] $\psi$ of $Y$, the [[Preimage]] $\psi^{-1}(C)$ has [[Lebesgue Measure]]: $$m(\psi^{-1}(C))=0$$in [[Euclidean Space]].
