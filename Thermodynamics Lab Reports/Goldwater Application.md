During the summer of 2023, I participated in an REU at the University of Michigan Dearborn. Under the mentorship of Dr Keshav Pohkrel, I joined a group of 3 students studying Bayesian statistics. We employed computational methods to apply a survival regression model to ... 

Each morning, we would meet for a couple hours. We reviewed fundamental probability theory and discussed recent papers. We reviewed known algorithms for computational Bayesian parameter estimation including ... (CITE). We also discussed the importance of various data visualization tools... We compared derivations and talked about results. We prepared for presentations...

I spent most afternoons working independently. Tasks included deriving distributions and likelihood functions. Later on, my focus shifted to implementing the models we had created. I learned the programming languages R and Stan. Stan is a domain specific software that implements No-U-Turn sampling. Even though I was learning new programming languages for this project, my previous experience was helpful. I have spent many hours practicing writing efficient readable code and debugging programs for computer science and independent projects. These skills helped ... 

I adjusted input parameters and experimented with various techniques (specify: priors) to improve convergence. I moved onto testing the models. We learned about several methods for evaluating model prediction accuracy. One was reproducing known results. 

We tested cross validation, but ran into issues with censored data points. 

We settled on a likelihood-based information criterion for model testing.

I learned about using statistics both for checking for convergence, and comparing different models.



I also started building a web app with rshiny. One of our goals for the project was to create an accessible tool for users to apply our regression model to their data sets. 


Abstract:
We propose a Bayesian generalized Weibull regression method and develop Accelerated Time to Failure models using Bayesian methods. The parameter estimation procedure is carried out using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with No-U-Turn Sampler and compares the results of generalized Weibull regression with exponentiated Weibull regression, Weibull regression, and log-normal distribution across simulated and clinical data sets. We examine the effectiveness of generalized Weibull distribution as a survival model and compare it to more studied probability distributions. In addition to monotone and bathtub hazard shapes, the additional shape parameter in the generalized Weibull distribution provides flexibility to model a broader class of monotone hazard rates. 
Different model diagnostics tests such as the five-fold cross validation method, Akaike information criterion, and the Bayesian information criterion demonstrate the generalized Weibull distribution’s prediction accuracy. We found the generalized Weibull model to have superior results for multiple hazard function types. We also developed a Shiny app to dynamically visualize our models using real life data from lung cancer, heart attack, and German breast cancer studies. The app’s interactive interface lets users input their own data sets and see Weibull regression18
