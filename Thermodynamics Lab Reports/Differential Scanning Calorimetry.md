Introduction

Differential scanning calorimetry measures the thermal energy flow through a sample over a range of temperatures. It will be used to quantitatively determine the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of naphthalene. The structure of naphthalene is shown in Figure 1. The formation entropy of naphthalene may then be estimated: $$\begin{equation}\bar{S}^{\circ}_{298}=\int_{0\ K}^{298\ K}\frac{C_{p}(T)}{T}dT\end{equation}.$$

Experimental

Two lid-pan pairs were chosen and weighed with HIGH PRECISION. The masses are given in Table 1. One combination was crimped with the Mettler press to be used as a blank.

The sapphire reference was placed in the second sample holder. It was weighed by difference to give a mass of $24.358\ mg$. Both the blank and reference samples were placed in the instrument. Figure 2 shows a diagram of the setup. The sapphire sample holder was not crimped for this run. Differential scanning calorimetry was conducted with the Mettler Toledo: DSC 3+ model. The method consisted of a hold at $-160^{\circ}C$ for $5$ minutes, a linear ramp at $20^{\circ}C$ per minute to $30^{\circ}C$, and a hold at $30^{\circ}C$ for 5 minutes. A second run was conducted replacing the sapphire reference with $21.066\ mg$ of naphthalene. The sample was ground into a fine powder and tamped tightly into the pan to ensure uniform heat transfer. The naphthalene was manufactured by J T Baker Chemical Co (FORMAT!) and had a residue after ignition of $.002\%$. The sample holder was crimped before the final run.

Results

The heat capacity of naphthalene was measured in $1^{\circ}C$ increments from $-160^{\circ}C$ to $30^{\circ}C$. Selected data points are reported in Table 2, and the heat capacity is plotted against temperature in Figure 3.

Discussion


Eq 1 gives a method for determining the formation entropy of naphthalene. The contribution over the measured temperature range is given by the area under the curve of Figure 4:$$\begin{equation}\Delta S=\int_{123\ K}^{298\ K} \frac{C_{p}}{T}dT\approx \sum_{T=123\ K}^{298\ K} \frac{C_{p}}{T}\end{equation}=29.2186\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}.$$

The Debye law effectively extrapolates heat capacities at temperatures on the order of $10\ K$. Because the temperature range of the instrument was so limited however, the Debye law underestimates $\bar{S}_{123}^{\circ}$. Instead, a crude linear model is more prudent here. Fitting the function $y=mx+b$ to the data point $C_{p}=8.36\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$ at $T=123\ K$ and the Third Law limit $C_{p}=0$ at $T=0$ give the model $$
C_{p}=.067879\ \frac{J}{K^{2}\ mol}\ T.
$$Accordingly, the estimate $$\bar{S}_{123}^{\circ}=\int_{0\ K}^{123\ K} \frac{C_{p}}{T}dT=\int_{0\ K}^{123\ K}.067879\ \frac{J}{K^{2}\ mol}\ dT=8.36\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$$was made, giving a formation entropy value of $$\bar{S}_{298}^{\circ}=\int_{0\ K}^{123\ K} \frac{C_{p}}{T}\ dT+\int_{123\ K}^{298\ K} \frac{C_{p}}{T}\ dT=37.58\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}.$$

A literature value of the formation enthalpy of naphthalene is $\bar{S}_{298}^{\circ}= 166.86\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$, and several sources give values between $160$ and $170\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$. The extrapolation method used for the low temperature limit is far from perfect. However, temperatures up to $123\ K$ make up less than $25\%$ of $\bar{S}_{298\ K}^{\circ}$, and errors in numerical approximation likely contribute an error of at most $\pm 4\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$. The drastic difference between our result and literature values may be attributed to systematic error in the instrument. It was not calibrated for entropy determinations, so the data is not significant.

A few literature values for the heat capacity of naphthalene at $298\ K$ are $159.4,168.0,$ and $165.6\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$ (CITE). Our value of $57.11\ \frac{J}{K\ mol}$ is also significantly lower than the literature reference. 
The large error in the heat capacity data confirms the conclusion of systematic error.


Conclusion

The data was not significant, since the instrument used was not calibrated properly. Regardless, our results still demonstrate the temperature dependence of heat capacities. The expected trends were observed in the data, despite the magnitude of measurements being inaccurate. The experimental method and numerical approximation supplement provide an effective determination of formation entropies.
