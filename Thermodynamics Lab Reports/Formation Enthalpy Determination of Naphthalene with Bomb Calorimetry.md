Introduction

Bomb calorimetry is a constant volume calorimetry process where thermal changes due to combustion of an organic solid are measured. The bomb refers to a vessel with strong walls that maintain volume despite the explosive combustion reaction inside. This experiment studied the hydrocarbon naphthalene, an aromatic compound with chemical formula $C_{10}H_{8}$. The bicylic fused ring structure of naphthalene is given by Figure 1 ... (Cite handbook?) The chemical equation describing the combustion of naphthalene is $$\begin{equation}
C_{10}H_{8}(s)+12O_{2}(g)\rightarrow 10CO_{2}(g)+4H_{2}O(l)
\end{equation}$$We determined the enthalpy of reaction for Eq 1 ($\Delta H_{c}^{\circ}$) and used it to calculate naphthalene's enthalpy of formation ($H_{f}^{\circ}(C_{10}H_{8})$).

Experimental

Two pellets were prepared using .90 g and .80 g of naphthalene supplied by JT Baker (FORMAT), respectively. The crystalline powder was formed into pellets using the Parr pellet press. The pellets were weighed using a microgram balance. The weights are given in Table ... (DELETE THIS SENTENCE?) Two bomb assemblies were used, numbered bomb 1 and bomb 2 for the first and second pellet, respectively. Prior to assembly, $1.00 \text{ }g$ of thermally equilibrated deionized water was added to the bomb canister (Explain why?). The bomb was then assembled as shown in Figure ... with care taken to ensure contact between the cotton thread and ignition wire and the pellet (work on wording). Thread issued by the instrument manufacturer was used to meet calibration standards.

The Parr Bomb Calorimeter was used to charge the bomb with Oxygen gas and evacuate its atmospheric content. The bomb was charged and vented twice before a final charging. A high capacity balance was used to measure the addition of $2000.00\text{ }g$ of thermally equilibrated deionized water to the bomb bucket. The calorimeter was run on each bomb. Its thermometer and stir rod were dried and allowed to thermally equilibrate between runs. After the first run, residue from the combustion was left in the bomb canister.

Discussion

The molar change in enthalpy is given by 
$$\begin{align}
&\Delta H_{c}^\circ=\Delta U_{c}^\circ+\Delta(PV)\\
&\Delta(PV)=\Delta n_{gas}RT\\
&\Delta U^{\circ}_{c}=\Delta U^{\circ}\cdot m(C_{10}H_{8})
\end{align}$$(Work on formatting) where $\Delta n_{gas}$ is the change in the number of moles of gas in the bomb, $R$ is the gas constant (8.31446 $J K^{-1}mol^{-1}$ CITE lab manual) $T$ is the absolute starting temperature of the apparatus, and $m(C_{10}H_{8})$ is the molar mass of naphthalene. $\Delta U^\circ$ is equivalent to the gross heat given in Table 1, since this is the change in system energy. A sample calculation of $\Delta HÂº$ is shown for run 1. Because of the water put in the canister prior to combustion, we assumed that the amount of gaseous water did not change. Therefore $\Delta n_{gas}=-2$, as this is the difference in stoichiometric coefficients of gas in the combustion expression (Eq. 1).$$ 
\begin{align*}
&\Delta U_{c}^\circ=39.7542 \frac{kJ}{g}\cdot128.171 \frac{g}{mol \text{ }C_{10}H_{8}}=-5095.34 \frac{kJ}{mol \text{ }C_{10}H_{8}}\\
&\Delta(PV)=-2 \frac{mol \text{ gas}}{mol \text{ }C_{10}H_{8}}\cdot8.31446 \frac{J}{K \text{ }mol \text{ gas}}\cdot21.4581K=-356.825 \frac{J}{mol \text{ }C_{10}H_{8}} \\
&\Delta H_{c}^\circ=-5095.34 \frac{kJ}{mol}-.3568 \frac{kJ}{mol}= -5095.69 \frac{kJ}{mol}

Literature values for the formation enthalpies of $H_{2}O(l)$ and $CO_{2}(g)$ are given in Table 3. $\Delta H^{\circ}(O_{2}(g))=0$, since this is the most stable form of elemental Oxygen at standard pressure. The molar enthalpy of formation for naphthalene may be calculated from Hess's Law: $$\begin{equation}
H^\circ_f({C_{10}H_{8}})=10H^\circ_f({CO_{2}(g)})+4H^\circ_f({H_{2}O(l)})-12H^\circ_f({O_{2}(g)})-\Delta H_{c}^\circ
\end{equation}$$It was found to be: $$\begin{equation*}
H^\circ_{f}({C_{10}H_{8}})=10\cdot-393.5 \frac{kJ}{mol}+4\cdot -285.83 \frac{kJ}{mol}-5124.73 \frac{kJ}{mol}=46.41 \frac{kJ}{mol}
\end{equation*}$$

Discussion
A literature value for the enthalpy of combustion of naphthalene is $-5157 \frac{kJ}{mol}$. 
Two literature values for the enthalpy of formation of naphthalene are $77. \pm 10. \text{ }\frac{kJ}{mol}$ (CITE) and $78.5 \frac{kJ}{mol}$ (CITE). We gathered insufficient data to make statistical claims about our results. However, we can attempt to qualitatively explain the trends between the observed and literature results.

We observed a residue left in bomb $1$ after its run, indicating that the naphthalene pellet did not fully combust. Incomplete combustion likely decreased the observed gross heat and increased the average enthalpy of reaction since less energy was released than should have been. In turn, the calculated value of naphthalene's formation enthalpy was reduced.

Another possible source of error comes from the amount of naphthalene used. After the first run, the instrument warned us that the observed temperature rise exceeded the expected change. This may also have affected the integrity of the gross heat value for run $1$, leading to lower calculated combustion and formation enthalpies. As less naphthalene was used for the second run, the temperature change stayed within the expected range and no warning was issued.

The large relative error in the experimental value of naphthalene's formation enthalpy comes from the difference in Eq (NUMBER). Because the absolute errors propagate through subtraction, and the formation enthalpy of naphthalene is about $2$ orders of magnitude less than the enthalpy of combustion, we can rationalize the much larger relative error for the formation enthalpy. Were we to collect more data and propagate the error, this relationship would be made quantitatively apparent. This would cause both the systematic error from residue and various random errors to have a larger relative effect on the formation enthalpy.

The enthalpy of formation is defined as the reaction enthalpy of assembling a compound from its component elements. It is a convention that allows us to describe the absolute enthalpy of a compound. Formation enthalpies are useful to tabulate, since we can use them to calculate reaction enthalpies directly. They are also used for experimental determination of other formation enthalpies, as was done here with $H_{2}O(l)$ and $CO_{2}(g)$.

Conclusion
We obtained values for the enthalpy of combustion ($\Delta H_{c}^{\circ}=-5124.73 \frac{J}{mol}$) and enthalpy of formation ($H_{f}^{\circ}=46.41 \frac{J}{mol}$) for naphthalene. Experimental error, lack of replicates, and the large relative error in formation enthalpy values all affected the accuracy of our $H_{f}^{\circ}(C_{10}H_{8})$ determination. To improve results, more runs should be conducted. Runs where residue makes it apparent that combustion was incomplete should be discarded.
